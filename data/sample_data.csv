3.0,Terrific for some but not for everyone,"Giro quality but not a Giro fit. Sizing for the Giro Dime is awkward. Circumference works for my 1st grader (48 in, 52 lbs) but the head cavity is shallower than his Giro Flume. As a result, the Dime exposes too much of his forehead to be considered a proper fit. Too bad too because the Dime is very well constructed and more attractive than similar style helmets from other manufacturers. Overall, I think it's a 4/5 star helmet if it manages to fit you, and a 1/2 star helmet if it doesn't. Not as universal a fit as the other Giro helmets I have purchase, hence the 3 star rating.<br /><br />Additional: I ordered one in matte blue and found the hue to be deceptive. While the blue photographs like a very blue sky, it appears to my naked eye more like a teal blue. I snapped some images on my ipad and in each of the photos the hue looks identical to the website image.

5.0,Great customer service!,"[[VIDEOID:bc5d0fcc7eb3c42376f3952bd340739d]] I bought the Meidase SL 122 Pro game camera earlier this year to replace my non-infrared game camera that was slow to wake and startled the game with the flash.<br /><br />The Meidase worked well for a month until a woodpecker decided that it's privacy was being invaded and attacked two of the three motion sensors.  They still worked but the protective coverings were damaged, leaving the camera without weather protection.<br /><br />I contacted Meidase to see if there was some way to replace the protective lenses, but was told that that was not possible and that they would send me a replacement.  Well, the USPS lost the replacement.  I filed a missing package report with the USPS and a couple of weeks later they let me know that they could not find it and dropped the whole thing.  I informed Meidase of this and they quickly sent me another one...which the USPS did not lose.<br /><br />This review is largely just about Meidase's Customer Service, which was excellent.  They went over and above in their service given that the damage was not their fault and not covered in the warranty.<br /><br />I've included a video of the woodpecker attack, some deer, and Venus and the Moon setting over S.E.

Yeah, it's a huge and heavy bag, but that's only because I do a lot of cold weather hiking and camping; after almost freezing to death in a 20 degree bag, you tend to opt for something heavy. ANYWAY, in my haste, I took one look the size of the medium, shook my head,  and ordered an XL compression bag. This morning, I thought, &#34;let's see if I can get that ridiculously large bag in that medium sack,&#34; and somehow, it freaking worked. I didn't try to 'roll' it, I just stuffed it in there.

4.0,Fitbit vs Nike Fuelband - Deciding factors for me,"I bought my first Fitbit last year after trying the Nike Fuelband for about a year. I'll do a comparison of the two for those that are considering one or the other:<br /><br />Build: The Fitbit is a little smaller than the Nike and, at least for me, this is a good thing. The fitting system is a bit more granular, with multiple holes available for all wrist-sizes, as opposed to the Nike which, essentially, gave you 2 choices for whichever band size you happened to order. I'm using the larger black wristband, and it fits perfectly (snug-but-not-too-snug). It doesn't jiggle around when I move (unlike my Nike).<br /><br />Ease of charging: The Nike wins out here, since I could just take it off my wrist and plug into any available USB port, whereas the Fitbit requires you to take the small electronic sensor out of the wristband, insert it into the special adapter provided with the wristband, and then plug into a USB port. I've had one or two issues with plugging into a 2.1A USB port as opposed to a 1A, but generally it charges fine.<br /><br />Ease of syncing: The Fitbit syncs via a USB dongle that plugs into your computer or by Bluetooth to your mobile device (I'm using a Moto X on Android 4.4.3). The dongle seems a little extraneous, but I have one constantly plugged into my home Mac Mini and one in my Macbook Air, so I rarely have reason to turn BT on to sync with my phone or iPad. Syncing occurs pretty quickly and painlessly. The Nike, from what I remember, was also relatively painless, but ONLY could sync with a mobile device unless plugged into the USB port. So, while the Fitbit does inexplicably require a dongle, this dongle makes syncing much more painless.<br /><br />Everyday use: I am a pretty sweaty guy, but neither the Fitbit nor the Nike had any real long-term issues with cleanliness on a daily basis. I wore both in the shower, and this (combined with hand washing during the day) seemed to do the job of cleaning them both. The Nike did have more slots and grooves, and I do remember getting some sunscreen in there one day that was a pain to clean out. As mentioned, the better fit of the Fitbit meant that I didn't really notice it around my wrist as much as I did the Nike, which tended to jiggle around. The Fitbit is also a bit flatter, which meant it didn't really get in the way when typing on a computer or doing any other daily activities.<br /><br />Battery-use: Both started with excellent battery life. I routinely got up to 7 days with my Fitbit before needing a charge (similar with the Nike). However, both had gradual degradation in battery life. With the Fitbit, I actually had to get a replacement after 8 months of use since I could no longer get more than 16 hours or so out of one full charge, which meant I had to charge it every night. This also meant that I couldn't take advantage of the sleep-tracking function since it had to be charging.<br /><br />The Nike also lost charge duration over time, but it was slightly less abrupt and a little more gradual than the Fitbit. After about a year with the Nike, I went from 5-7 days/charge to 2-3.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />I'd probably recommend the Fitbit over the Nike, if only because it seems to be a little less intrusive in your life. There are many more differences between the two that I'm sure are outlined in other reviews, like intricacies in the software and which phones/mobile devices they can sync with, and I'm happy to answer questions, but these are the main differences which, for me, mean I'd probably choose the Fitbit if I had to choose again. Make sure you order from Amazon, or somewhere with similar great customer service, since I did have to replace it after 8 months, and that was relatively pain-free through Amazon.",[],B00BGO0Q9O,B00BGO0Q9O,AED5E2JZOSZJDKBBXZBUZPUFLG4Q,1405353618000,1,True

My next purchase will be a the 18 pound ball when the 16 pound ball is no longer a challenge. Please see the video.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />This ball is constructed well. It is made similar to the bouncing medicine balls at the gym. I found the 12 lb balls at the gym a little too light. The 4 extra lbs did the trick.

4.0,Sweet Birthday Baby Skates,"“I don’t know if I’m on board with this plan. You’re fragile. And honestly, not that graceful.”<br />-my favorite husband<br /><br />I just revisited my social media posts, and sure enough: I had posted TWICE about wanting roller skates:<br />October 29, 2020:<br />Does anyone have any suggestions about brands/sources for purchasing outdoor roller skates? I’ve been having a weird urge to revisit my childhood and/or bust my knee again.<br />I feel like I might need a little more arch support now than I did at 9.<br /><br />January 5, 2022:<br />Y’all. I am in a serious funk.<br />Please stop me from buying roller skates to try to cheer myself up. I am a clumsy oaf with arthritis and joints that don’t work properly. I will absolutely hurt myself.<br />So what brand of skates do you recommend for street use?<br />->Fast forward to now-><br />When my birthday rolled around this year, I decided to do a little something special just for me.  This is the end of my 40s and I’m fairly certain that the longer I wait, the harder it will be to restore the muscle memory.<br /><br />When I was a kid, there was a roller rink called Skate World that was just a few blocks from my house.  They would give you a free skate pass for every A on your report card.  I was a pretty good student so every six weeks I would clutch my report card tight and beg my parents to take me to get my coupons.  My friends and I went every Saturday if we could.  I can still smell the smell of old carpet, Lysol spray, pizza grease and birthday cake.  My childhood skates were white.  For my birthday one year I got them decked out with pompoms,sparkly laces, and matching wheels.  I thought I was something else.  My bff and I used to hold hands and skate during the “couples skate” so we didn’t miss out on a single song and we would Shoot the Duck and Ballin’ the Jack:<br />Now...<br />First you put your two knees close up tight<br />Then, you sway it to the left and you sway it to the right<br />Step around the floor kind of nice and light<br />Then you twist around, you twist around with all of your might<br />Stretch your lovin' arms straight out in space<br />Then you do the Eagle Walk-a with-a style and grace<br />Swing your foot way 'round and bring it back<br />Now that's what I call Ballin' the Jack!<br /><br />So let’s get to the review:<br />This little wheely babies are pink!  Like, so pink they are pank.  I looked up pank to make sure it was just the Tennessee pronunciation of pink and not something terrible and it looks like pank can also mean “professional aunt, no kids” which is exactly what I am so I’m claiming the word pank twice.<br />The “leather” is weird, but I think that the texture looks better on the pink than the black.  Maybe that’s just my personal preference but if you aren’t going to have real leather, might as well make it fun. I am concerned that they wouldn’t hold up as long, but let’s get real.  I’m a 49 year old woman skating again for the first time since I was a teenager.  It’s not going to take me long to break something vital and have to give up skating for good.  And if you are buying skates for kids, you know their foot is going to out-grow the skate before the boot wears out.<br />And the wheels?  Gorgeous.  Little baby Sirsee would have killed for these wheels. They appear to be clear, but start skating and the friction lights them up! With winter coming and the days getting shorter, I can imagine a few end of the work day laps around the block before nightfall.  The increased visibility will be a huge plus.<br />My dog, The Reverend, HATES the light up wheels. He might just hate shoes that roll.<br /><br />I like the way the black soles are complemented by the black toe stops.  It keeps the pink boot and shiny wheels from being too cutesy.<br />And while I wouldn’t mind some pink glitter laces ala 1984, I respect the choice to carefully match them to the boot, giving a clean, cohesive look.<br /><br />I wear a size 7 in most shoes, and size up to a 7.5-8 in sneakers.  These size 7 (38) skates fit just right.<br />The ankle feels it might need a little breaking in, but the entire inside of the skate is lined with soft flannel so even trying them on without socks (I couldn’t wait!) they were actually pretty comfortable.<br />The arch support is virtually nonexistent but I didn’t expect them to have any and there is a bit of cushion in the lining.<br />I can wear medium weight socks or tights with these with no problem.<br />They are currently paving the street in front of my house which gives me time to get some protective gear, but I have rolled around inside and on the driveway and I think with a bit of practice I should be ready to roll.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613f4chX9wL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613f4chX9wL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613f4chX9wL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Zq9FL83bL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Zq9FL83bL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Zq9FL83bL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Nmi-UnyjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Nmi-UnyjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Nmi-UnyjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BDDWTSTL,B0BDDTX5BY,AH5BM7UIZMDMUD52JPBADSJ6A67A,1667431314429,3,False

5.0,"Good to have when packing light, just in case","I would probably not wear this on my wrist, but I tried it out anyways. I loosened the adjustment buckle to allow for some slack and then fastened the buckle around my wrist. It is impossible to cinch the adjustment loop with one hand, but I figured I could grab the end of the paracord in my teeth and was able to cinch it up that way. It was comfortable enough, kinda like a big watch, but I will attach these to my packs or bike bags.<br /><br />Looking at the strap, I wanted to figure out how I would unravel the paracord so that I was not trying to do that while in the dark. If you use your thumb to feel where the cord attaches to the plastic, you will feel the rough melted end of the paracord. Once you start pulling on that, it should be easy to unravel the paracord and this would need to be done for both sides.<br /><br />I was not impressed with the whistle at first, but I was inadvertently overlapping my lips with the second hole where the air escapes. I found it easier to use the whistle by turning it 90 degrees, right or left, and I was able to produce a loud whistle more easily.<br /><br />The flint and striker are less noticeable and I spent the most time trying to figure these out. First, it took a bit of wiggling and tugging to get the striker out of its slot. It is small, so if you drop it, it might be hard to find. The flint is not removable and, since it is between the buckle prongs, it is a bit difficult to get to with the striker. When I really need it, I am likely going to bend the prongs out of the way if not break them off if necessary. I took a piece of sandpaper to rough up the flint and after a few tries I was able to coax out some sparks.<br /><br />Lastly, the compass worked like a compass and I did not find anything notable.

4.0,A good fitness tracker,"I like the Fitbit Blaze but I don't love it.  It replaced a Fitbit Surge which I liked a lot more but I wanted something newer after my Surge died.  I have had the Blaze for 15 months now and it has held up well overall.  But I think that I might be starting to see the battery going; it still holds a charge for multiple days right now but originally it would last almost a week.<br /><br />My biggest complaint so far is about Fitstar: I really liked this feature when I first got the Blaze but quickly learned that it was largely abandoned and that there is no customization available.  You get three exercise routines and that's it.  I would love to have had the ability to put the exercises that I want on the watch, like some stretching or yoga poses.  My other complaints are about lack of customization for the watch face.  They offer a decent number of variations but I only like three of them.  I do not understand why they cannot set it up to choose the watch face style and the colors separately - that would open up a lot more options.<br /><br />I am giving it 4 stars based on my personal experience with the watch.  I do plan to update this review when the watch fails (which I expect to happen within a year).  Sadly, my employer has strict rules about electronic devices, so I might end up buying another Fitbit product after this even if I don't want to (Fitbit is definitely the Blackberry of the smart watch arena).",[],B01KH28KAW,B01KH28KAW,AGXNL5RRNRWQFGIPDISK6WCC35WQ,1551560294109,1,True

This mat doesn't slip around on the floors, your hands don't slip on it in downward facing dog, it's the perfect thickness so  that you have stability in balance poses, but you also have great cushion for your joints. It's beautiful too. It is heavier than a foam mat, so prepare yourself for that when you are carrying it around with you to the gym or studio. And it is literally less than half the price of the leading natural rubber mats out there. Seriously 90 bucks was what I was prepared to spend until I found this gem.

I wanted a fitness-focused device and not a fancy gadget like an Apple watch and I do like gadgets. I really looked at all the details and choose this. I am glad I did. The Fitbit Surge's charge lasts for days, tracks sleep quality, has the time display always on, AND has GPS the Apple Watch does not. I feel all the features work well. I used to own the Fitbit Force and this is so much better and usable than that one. The GPS works very good and I like using it. I used to use Map My Fitness for this but Fitbit does the route tracking just as good now. Yesterday, I got a call while my phone was charging but didn't hear it. The Surge however vibrated on my arm and so I did not miss the call. Text messages same deal. Works great. I highly recommend the Surge for those most concerned about fitness and health.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61g7oz1-XhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61g7oz1-XhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61g7oz1-XhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZgaiMZj7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZgaiMZj7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZgaiMZj7L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00N2BWF6Q,B00N2BWF6Q,AHTBIC2TILY3KLMRTXJJKXWSK7CQ,1436053229000,13,False

I examined the threads, castings, and sharp definition of the teeth on the chainwheel and found no defects or signs of poor quality<br /><br />I tested the crankset on my favorite dirt roads.  There were no problems with shifting.  The chain retention was positive.  I had the same positive experience with shifting on the VUNDO unit mounted on my mountain bike.<br /><br />I used the appropriate crankset installation tool, 5mm, 4mm, and and 8mm hex wrenches to install the crankset. I set the crank arm screws at 8 ft lbs. I torqued the bottom bracket cups to 25 ft lbs.  So far no parts have loosened at these torque settings.  Since I don't know the quality of the crankset alloy, I was judicious in my torque settings.<br /><br />Overall, the VUNDO crankset is a good value. I ordered several size chainwheels since they are easy to fit and I can tailor my gearing to my routes.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vtP7-A0gL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vtP7-A0gL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vtP7-A0gL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FCuMjwJgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FCuMjwJgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FCuMjwJgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uH7smg41L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uH7smg41L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uH7smg41L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08TR1BQS5,B08TR1BQS5,AGTBYJVPKERXUXU36A4IEE4EKNBQ,1650508235249,0,True

This is definitely not a backpacking sleeping bag it is big and in the stuff sack that it comes with it is the size of a 30L pack and it is way heavier than a down bag. I purchased this more for car camping and the likes which it is perfect for. It has a fleece lining at the base for your feet which is a nice addition if you want to take your socks off. Its not overly warm and it has a full length zipper on the left side which is nice. I don't usually zip it up as i like the feel of it being more like a sheet or blanket and since it is so wide you can get away with it without feeling like your stuck in the mummy position like with smaller bags when you open the zipper and half your body is uncovered. Great bag for casual camping and at the price if it doesn't last who cares throw it out and buy another.,[],B00363V3M2,B00363V3M2,AEC35SADYFHWNP2T3AJNFFNIHNBA,1469800270000,2,True

The rubber is thick but still stretchy and the chains and spikes are stainless steel and holding up very well. My only small complaint is that the configuration of the spike plates, with two spikes on one side and a third spike on the opposite side, creates a kind of pocket that sometimes traps chunks of snow or ice. This can result in a buildup of snow that I have to stop to remove. This mostly happens when it's warm and the snow is sticky, but it can be frustrating. Some other brands of cleats have the plates arranged without the third, opposing spikes and would be better in this respect. Still, these work very well, especially for the price.",[],B07G5DZGFB,B07SN2T7KK,AG4YGYW5A3JFXVBVKCD7GR5NAXUQ,1551571428122,0,True

4.0,Nice tree strap and hammock combo for the price,"It is always so weird to me to read the 1-star and 2-star reviews on products that I really love and compare the “bad” things to my product to see if they match the complaints. For example, this hammock is treating me great and I have been an avid hammock-camper for a couple of years now.<br />First things first, I got my product in the mail only 2 days after ordering it. I really do appreciate when sellers stay on top of their orders and keep their word about how long it takes to ship their products! It gives me confidence in making future purchases with them when I have a time-restraint (like for Christmas and Birthday gifts).<br /><br />Positives: The material is lightweight and it stays true to the lime green color. For me, the lighter the material, the better since we try to cut weight down during backpacking trips. It comes with a rope, caribiners, and packs into itself with a built-in bag.<br />I would say the best thing about this hammock is that it comes with tree straps already. I usually have to purchase these separately, so for 19.99 for a lightweight hammock and straps, this is a great deal.<br /><br />Cons: I wish I could say that the product is perfect, but it is not. The one thing I would improve is the stitching. It is not the best stitching, and it is too close to the edge so it may come apart faster than other hammocks. Second, it comes with a THICK rope that attaches the hammock ends to caribiners. This rope really should not be this thick, and should be more along the size of paracord. Aside from that, this hammock and tree strap set is decent.<br /><br />I received this product at a promotional price for my review.",[],B00XOOS02E,B00XOOS02E,AGM3HJDSGY67XMYR2PJCU3VENO7Q,1453261918000,0,False

Its lightweight aspect belies its strength. The long length combined with the tapered grip (alot smaller than what I'm used to) meets that fastball aggressively.<br /><br />Is there anything I would want to change? Only one -- the grip -- add a 1/16 inch more to that diameter and the extra weight will be negligible -- the reaction should be negligible also, but the grip will not twist in my hands the way this one does.

While this looks and feels like a normal medicine ball, it has a very strong chemical smell that does not go away after opening.  I have used many medicine balls at gyms before over the years, and definitely this one is different.  The smell lingers on my hands even after touching it briefly.  The smell does not go away after washing the ball, and you must wash your hands to get the smell off.  This suggests VOC's offgassing from the ball and other chemicals that most likely are unhealthy to have on the skin.  If you are pregnant, or may become pregnant, I would be particularly cautious about exercising with this type of material coming onto your skin. I believe the issue is so bad that the manufacturer should respond, take responsibility for this mistake, and change their manufacturing practices.  I will be returning my ball, once I find another cardboard box to put it in (I had thrown my away in my excitement upon receiving the ball).",[],B00R3N712M,B00S0QDD8C,AEV674LBQ3HOFYBULVOZ6ELEWJVQ,1520468408075,17,True

Now that he is about 40 lbs and 42"" tall, we needed a new front riding solution. This is so awesome. I was originally skeptical about the fit, but not anymore!  At home, it is mounted on a 26"" Schwinn cruiser style. I packed it on a trip to visit family and mounted it on a 24"" mountain bike.  Works great on both.<br /><br />A couple of caveats:<br /><br />- Your bike should be sized so that you can plant at least the balls of your feet on the ground on both sides for safety. There is no 'popping off the seat' at stops.<br />- Forget clip in pedals. Same reason as above.  If you need to stop, you better not be stuck in your pedals.<br />- consider adjusting handlebars so that you are in an upright position and not bent forward.<br /><br />For me, this was just perfect, and we both love being able to chat along our casual ride.",[],B0972R2TY4,B097331B7L,AEAJM2674PQEMMEFSFAX4M5XJMJA,1658609734954,4,True

5.0,Amazing Concept,"this bottle features what they call, free sip.....it's great! It allows you to choose to drink from a straw or a spout. The straw is built in so you won't loose it. Now the built in straw does make it a bit challenging to clean but with the right bottle/nipple brush it'll get done and very well. The double locking lid makes for a real non spill/leak bottle in my opinion. The bottle is a good size for an average hand width so carrying it is easy and not overwhelming.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Xiq5d6NrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Xiq5d6NrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Xiq5d6NrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61d2XX73duL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61d2XX73duL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61d2XX73duL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xAc8pILnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xAc8pILnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xAc8pILnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711wnuuaYeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711wnuuaYeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711wnuuaYeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BZSdFPugL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BZSdFPugL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BZSdFPugL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nV9TxCfdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nV9TxCfdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nV9TxCfdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81OabhhhSKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81OabhhhSKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81OabhhhSKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085DTY4VS,B092SR68FD,AFVTHPT46GLPZLSL64FJFXT2535A,1601770630912,0,False

Surprisingly there aren't a whole lot of options that make a nice full line, but Klean Kanteen has done well doing just that.  Clean, nice looking, and best yet it's a simple design that is incredibly easy to clean, but it is made easiest with a bottle brush that will fit inside.  Minus one star since my 10 year old brought it back on the first day with a dent on the bottom, and swears she didn't drop it more than a foot taking it out of her backpack.  Perhaps a little thicker wall on the bottom would make it more kid friendly.  But the paint was fine and dent is not noticeable when the bottle is standing.  Very nice product and whatever you put in it tastes like it should with no aftertaste.  I'll probably buy a couple of more for the car.",[],B0093IR4EK,B0093IR4EK,AEW6UMSSYEU3PBH7LWLYTGLFIUNQ,1410930466000,2,True

5.0,Lightweight Multifunctional Must Have Flashlight!,"I was very surprised how lightweight this flashlight is. Love all the functions of it, especially the fact it’s able to hang on the wall with just a small nail. Works great to hang on wall, light up the room, if the electricity goes out! The flashlight function is extremely bright & can be used as a spotlight, especially when fully charged. Also has the blinking light, which is great to use if your vehicle is in need of assistance. Great Price for a Great Flashlight!<br />I think everyone should have one of these flashlights in their home, car & camping equipment!<br />The only con I found to this flashlight is in the quick guide that came with it, it says to charge every 3mos. It definitely needs charged more often, depending on usage. I think the battery will run down faster than you think so might want to get a portable charger on hand if not near an outlet. Otherwise awesome flashlight, even better than some that are more expensive!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91+USgwipZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91+USgwipZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91+USgwipZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Oqxp+7qOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Oqxp+7qOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Oqxp+7qOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91TsYJAVL-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91TsYJAVL-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91TsYJAVL-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1B7TrvxzAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1B7TrvxzAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1B7TrvxzAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1PIRtki-dL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1PIRtki-dL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1PIRtki-dL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1w7-7Mk8uL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1w7-7Mk8uL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1w7-7Mk8uL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B096F976RZ,B096F976RZ,AEOGGMQ7VJ37A4A5L2GRJEVZWXUA,1626703502216,0,True

Lee doesn't want to take responsibility for any Glocked cases that may rupture if they are resized too many times. You'll have to decide what condition your brass is in. You will need their carbide crimp die which is included in Lee's 4 die sets.<br />I have used this for cases run through Gen 3 or later Glocks, and they don't exhibit any bulge, just the normal expansion from being shot through a looser barrel. Most of the time, the resizing die works fine without running it through the crimp die, but doing so is a safety check just in case you get a case that is bulged further down than the normal resizer reaches. Also, the case collector works great.",[],B005KW5F3K,B005KW5F3K,AGTBULU66N3JIHAVZHO6FR34FBGA,1391289947000,3,True

3.0,High-capacity bag; needs better stitching,"At first glance his bag seems great. You can change the length due to an ingenious system of loops and a Velcro tongue. this way you can take full size older skis that are 200 CM or so, but not have it flap around with shorter modern skis.<br />the inside is nicely designed with a flap to keep your bindings from digging into the other pair of skis, and tie-downs for skis and poles.<br />the bag is heavy and with two pairs of skis you're going to be pushing the envelope on weight.<br />People tell you that you can put into helmets and two pairs of boots, don't believe them, that may be possible but it is not wise to do so -- you'll go over weight, and the bag is not really shaped for boots and helmets. There is plenty of room in the bag with the skis to put parkas, ski clothes, and the like.<br />There's a nice-looking strap in the middle of the bag that makes it look like you can carry it like a suitcase. The bag is long enough and heavy enough that this really doesn't work very well. there should instead be removable longer straps that allow you to carry bag over your shoulder like most ski bags, or a golf bag. There are padded handles at both ends, which are very useful. They handle at the top end works well with the wheels.<br />Here's the problem, the stitching is no good. I've sent mine to the luggage repair place in Denver at several times to get the rubber scuff guards restitched, handles reinforced, zipper pulls replaced, stitching redone.<br />They really need to pay more attention in the actual assembly of the bag. The luggage people told me not to send it in again, that it's too beat up.<br />This bag has been all over the world, I work with a sports team.

3.0,"Besides some bad design choices, good game play","Looking for a cheap dartboard for the backyard that can take some abuse. This one so far has been solid but has some major design flaws.<br />Pros:<br />- Simple interface for game selection and options<br />- LED screen showing scores and 2 player status is well designed and intuitive. Shows the x's and o's for cricket.<br />- No annoying noises; minimal sound effects and low volume for double/triple hits<br />- Nice bigger red button for switching to 'next player.' If you ever plan on playing with guests, this is the one design option that is a must. There's nothing worse than messing up a game because someone who's new to the dartboard interface accidentally hits the wrong button.<br />- Pleasing red/white/blue color. Props for just having a different color scheme.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Poor mount design. There are basically two screw socket-mounts located at the top/back of the board and nowhere else. This means when pulling the thrown darts out (which can stick pretty well), the board lifts off the wall. This will likely stress the plastic mount points over time. This is a huge design oversight. Other boards are often easier to mount and are stable. I had to fashion two homemade 'zigzag-like' pieces that could then screw into the wall to secure the bottom of the board to the wall. You could also potentially just drill some screws into the plastic board (e.g., above the game menu and led score sections). But note you'll still have to deal with battery access.<br />- Poor battery access. This uses 3 AA batteries instead of an AC plug. To replace/install batteries, you have to 1) possess a very small Phillips screw driver normally used for eye glasses to open the cover, and 2) access the panel located on the back. Therefore, you must re-mount the board to change batteries. It is nice not having a AC plug allowing you to place the board nearly anywhere, but why make swapping batteries such a pain? Would it have been so hard to give access in the front?<br /><br />I have not had the board long enough to see how fast the batteries drain, but there are built in power saving features (e.g., automatic turn-off after 3 min of no play). This could be a play issue if you're dealing with a group of players where one person wanders off somewhere for too long.<br /><br />Despite the bad design choices for mounting and batteries, the board itself and darts are fine for the price. You can always get better darts. Like I mentioned, the user interface for game options and play are good and don't cause undue confusion. I expect to get many hours of play and am not worried about abusing the board since it was so inexpensive. The mounting issue can be worked out with a little ingenuity. As long as the battery does not need to be changed very often, then I would gladly buy this board again.",[],B00EX7EFKM,B00EX7EFKM,AEUIYDYJMBFT76POWEMJA2D5VXAA,1399935262000,0,True

I have great balance so I do not<br />need to hold on to anything like other reviewers have said.  Balance is all based on each individual.  Using a door frame<br />would be a great way for some to keep their balance.  Even with the smaller steps, you get a great workout.

5.0,One brain bucket to rule them all!,I bought this one after buying the regular dual certified on Amazon because the size just didn’t feel right even though I measured and used the size guide. No big deal on that one as it went to the kid and I got me this “better one”. The best part about this one is the Tony Hawk aspect. That guy is a legend and proud to rock his signature helmet on my noggin. The colors are fantastic as well and the “TH” logo on the back and on the liner pads are a nice touch. I got this one a size up from the other one I got and it seems to fit a lot better imo. I ended up using the xl pad in the rear and the lege pad in front. So far they are staying a snug fit but should they flatten out I can put the other smaller pad in to bring it a little tighter. I haven’t wrecked so I can’t speak to its protection but it feels like it will do fine. My only complaint is the holes for air to get in feel pretty rough like they didn’t clean them up much. I think for a helmet at this price those hole could be filed and more refined but that’s a nit pick type of thing. Overall I think this is a good helmet that fits and looks great.

1.0,Objects appear invisible until right up on you,"this mirror is terrible!  Well, let me restate that.  The mirror isn't so bad...seems to be good quality, good size and clear view...but only if you want to see objects once they are literally right up on you.  I have a helmet mirror that works well, but I thought i'd try a bike mirror since it's larger and therefore, more effective.  Not at all so.  I could see vehicles in my helmet mirror (which is also about a 1/4 the size) long before they were immediately behind me.  But with the bike mirror they appear non existent until they are within about 10 feet of you.  That's not going to do a whole lot of good if the purpose of the mirror is to provide precaution against a car headed right for you!  On my ride, I switched back and forth between the two mirrors and was really shocked at the ineffectiveness of this mirror.  Talk about ""objects appear MUCH further away than they really are""!  In this situation, I'd much rather have objects appear closer than they actually are...give me more time to prepare or get out of the way if necessary.",[],B07V5DJR8Z,B07V5F1NL9,AFFRBNJEEKZ6GLTQYV3EW5FEJTNA,1578518001298,36,True

2.0,... idea of your sleep and activity it is a great product. I like to get 10,"The Shine works well enough - if you are looking for a &#34;general&#34; idea of your sleep and activity it is a great product.  I like to get 10,000 steps per day and this little gadget that I don't need to worry about gives me that information.  I love that it just goes on my wrist and I don't need to think much about it (versus the Fitbit which I had to clip to my pants each day which meant it spent most days on my dresser...).<br /><br />One MAJOR disappointment though.  The &#34;sport band&#34; that it comes with - it doesn't actually hold onto the Shine that reliably.  It has fallen out numerous times.  Luckily there are some Bluetooth apps that have allowed me to find it (at work, in the car, in the garden and once in the trash bin).  When I contacted Misfit about the problem they stated &#34;We entirely understand your disappointment about Shine sport band issue. We are fully aware that the accessories for Shine need a lot of improvements. Please understand our product team is trying very hard to revise the design and fix the issue as soon as we can&#34;.  They offered me 10% off a band they sell ($50) that is intended to hold onto the Shine in a manner that it doesn't fall out when one is taking of their shirt, taking out the garbage, gardening, walking, etc.<br /><br />So, no thanks, $80 was enough $ - I'd expect that for that cost I'd get more than a cheap plastic band that doesn't actually firmly hold onto the Shine.",[],B00G9N3I7O,B00GN6ZSKC,AHHVGUCNHLBQBNPL5V3G3PZW6XKA,1432035064000,0,True

The packaging shows little english or shoe sizes but 46 seems to fit my size 12 foot just fine. I'm about 6'2 and 170lbs and the waders have ample room for a larger individual but snug down to fit me fine. There are studs in the felt bottom boots which I like for slippery stream beds. Just don't go walking across your wood floor! The waders feature a waterproof zippered pocket which will be great for a fishing license and ID. The belt and suspenders cinch down and are encrusted with the Tung Hsing logo. The waders include a patch kit in case of emergency. They are a dark green which can be beneficial or detremental depending on how much sun you get. The waders are a PVC material and will be hot in a more temporate environment. In a colder environment, they will keep you warmer. The seams appear professionally done and have neat and linear stitching. The felt on the boots appears to be evenly attached and the boots appear to have extra reinforcement in the right wear areas.

3.0,Horrible zipper and bad QA,"The good:  set up is about as easy as it gets.  Packing it back up will take a few tries, but once you ""get it"" it's quick and easy.  It held up to light rain better than I expected, but condensation is an issue when you have it closed up.  The flat pack and lightweight make it pretty east to store/transport.<br />The bad:  my tent arrived with the ends of the frame poles cracked off (there is a metal end piece that connects into a metal sleeve to join the ends of the frame poles into a hoop.  The tent could still be set up, but I'm not sure if it affected anything.  The zippers for the door are horrible.  They bind and won't close and/or will separate after being closed.  It's like the door is just slightly too small for the opening.  I ordered this tent a few weeks before I actually used it so it was out of the return period.  Coleman warrantied it.<br />Overall:  Despite the flaws and frustrations it's good for what it is.  I wouldn't trust it on any kind of camping trip that might be ruined by the zipper failing to close or where a storm is expected.  However, it's perfect for backyard camping because it's so easy to set up, at this point I don't really care if my kids ruin it and if the zipper pops open and it gets buggy or wet we can just go inside.",[],B00HN91YHY,B0B8FL36YY,AGAHVWR2CPVGXEKYUNFADXP3Y3UA,1578336663252,0,True

5.0,Reliable,"I ordered this set to replace an old set that finally broke after 7 years.  They are great for my needs, which is to serve as visibility flashers as well as a backup for my main light.  The headlight puts out enough light to get by in a pinch.<br /><br />The tail light is made entirely of clear red plastic, so it has great visibility from all sides.  This is an improvement over the old design.  The headlight still seems to be the same, with a compact and sleek design that looks good on the bike.<br />The battery life on these things is insane.  It's probably the best feature of them.<br />The old set ran with 100% reliability in some rough conditions.  They stayed on the bike through several winters.  Rained on, knocked around, and plus they were on my bike for Burning Man three times.<br />They're inexpensive so you don't have to worry about them, but are incredibly reliable.<br /><br />The only thing that failed on the old set was the retaining clip on the headlight.  It broke off and is the weak point in the design (if you can even call something a weak point which lasted through 7 years of heavy use - especially at this price).  However the light itself still functioned and I used it as a flashlight for a while.  During some de-cluttering I threw it away and quickly regretted it.  It was handy as a flashlight with that crazy battery life!  Makes me sad thinking of it buried in some landfill somewhere.  Bummer.  It deserved better.  But now I have another one ready to shine for years to come.<br /><br />You can buy these lights with confidence and know that they'll work for a long time.",[],B00BV6FQ8S,B0041D0XFO,AH4NGVP756FY6TBQDIMXQFMSIZXA,1543132865103,9,True

4.0,Surprisingly Good with Modification,"I ordered this product expecting to get the regular Kabar with a 5.25"" blade instead of the 7"" which I find a bit long. Instead the whole knife is 75% the size of the orginal, so the blade width and handle are also smaller. The handle in particular feels much narrower and ends up at only 4"" long. Someone else discribed this knife as being for hobbits. Personally, I think it would also be good for people with small hands but certainly not for someone with XXL hands, like me, or most men for that matter.<br /><br />So in short, the only thing this knife and the standard USMC Kabar share is the same style. They are two completely differnt products. So while I liked standard USMC Kabar but was looking for a shorter blade this knife just did not seem to work for me. Maybe ok for the wife or kids but not someone with man size hands.<br /><br />Feeling frusterated I went to the reviews of this knife here on Amazon and my complaint seems to be pretty standard. However, I came across a review by Saint Richard where he suggested taking the finger guard at the base of the handle off the top dull side of the blade so that your thumb can rest on the backside of the blade. Since I am not into knife fighting the guard on the top dull side of the blade never made sense to me anyways, so off it went.<br /><br />This simple modification made a world of differnce. The handle is still a bit small but with somewhere to put my thumb it is now usable. I actually find myself using this modified knife for yard work and surprised myself the other day when I found myself looking for it to take on a hike. The smaller weight and size make it a good knife for hiking.<br /><br />Thank you Saint Richard and Amazon.<br /><br />Pro's<br />- great steel, which you need to protect from rust<br />- blade length, which is better in my opinion for day to day tasks<br />- weight, lighter<br />- accessory's - the kydex sheath is a great option at a reasonable price<br /><br />Con's<br />- needs to be modified, per above, for mans hands and probably should be anyways for ease of use. The mod is easy with a hacksaw and file.<br />- Cost just about the same cost as a the standard blade - I am cheap and feel I am getting more with the standard blade but understand that workmanship and materials are closely matched between the two and therefore the cost should be comparable. So this con may just be in my head.<br /><br />Overall 4 out of 5 starts becasue with the modification I find myself using it a lot without the modificaiton maybe two stars.<br /><br />Karbar if you are reviewing why not make a 5.5"" Kabar with the blade shortened and no top dull side finger guard. Yes I understand it may not be as balanced for fighting but it would make a near prefect utility knife in my opinion.<br /><br />Update<br />They seemed to have listened to me and have come out with the Kabar Mark 1 Navy Utility knife which has a wider handle, no top finger guard and the added bonus of being a full flat grind. Check out the Kabar Mark 1 Navy knife it is excellent.",[],B000GKD41G,B000GKD41G,AF7V3KE6AKG64DKGY35FDZADFK4A,1274027636000,10,False

The adjustments were straight forward to make, but I felt the velcro used throughout could start to become abrasive against his head or under his chin after awhile.  Also, since there is a lot of cloth material used, I would think odor could potentially be an issue over time.  I did not wash this yet (his wrestling camp was only 1 week long), but would probably hand wash it if needed.  He liked the red color, and I liked that it was tight enough that it didn't droop down over his eyes or come undone while in use (while wrestling and watching wrestling I can't count how many times I've seen headgear move from it's intended place to eventually fall off or get tossed to the side).  There's also room to grow, so he hopefully get a few seasons of use out of it.  After a week of use, my son said it didn't hurt at all and that he likes it.

4.0,"Forget expensive dynamo setups, this is the real deal","Wow! What can I say, finally a well priced LED with reasonable battery life and a quality mounting system.<br /><br />LED lighting has advanced so rapidly over the past five years. At one time I had a pair of Xenons powered by a lead acid battery mounted to the frame, but this tiny little Cygolite lasts much longer and is at least as bright. It's simply that good.<br /><br />Recharging is simple - use any USB port. A cable is included but a power adapter is not. You may use your PC's USB port, or use a charger from e.g. a phone for a quicker refill.<br /><br />This time of year it's not normally dark during my commute, so I'm more often using the safety blinker mode. I can go *weeks* without having to recharge, using it on my twenty minute commute. I've never had this thing run out of power yet; I just recharge it when I remember to, and it's always good to go.<br /><br />When it's dark out, I find the medium setting to be totally adequate. Bright is... *really* bright. I seldom use it.<br /><br />The mounting bracket is simple and easy. The thumb screw tightens and you can latch it in place. If you have problems with the light shifting side to side, as a previous reviewer apparently did, you can simply tighten the phillips head screw in the mounting bracket to make lateral movements require more force.<br /><br />We've been getting a ton of rain, and it's held up in the weather just fine without any discernable issues.<br /><br />The UI is good. Single press advances through modes, long press turns off while ""saving"" the current mode for power on.<br /><br />I'd been considering dynamo hubs, but honestly, I think this little guy is all I will reasonably need.<br /><br />Four stars instead of five because:<br /><br />- the battery does not seem to be interchangeable - having a spare battery would sure be nice for extended trips, and being able to swap out the battery when the included one eventually dies would extend the usable life of the light.<br /><br />- no ""battery death imminent"" warning from the UI, at least none that is documented or that I've seen (although the long battery life mitigates this). This encourages me to charge more frequently than is really necessary so I don't get surprised.<br /><br />- price is high relative to ""regular"" non-bike flashlights of this quality, but acceptable given the quality of the mounting solution versus what you'd get by trying to strap a regular torch on the bike",[],B008VUTP9I,B086ZN77SG,AEQ2DLZFQ2QF7PCNFYFN2GZNUONA,1374256438000,12,True

We needed the mask immediately, since this happened mid-season, and did not have the time for an exchange.<br /><br />The mask was already tight, but we used the cushions provided to add breathing room between the mask and his face. The cheek pads sweated loose the first wearing; we attempted to reattach with minimal success as they finished sweating off the second wearing to be lost somewhere between the ball field and our car.  The forehead pads lasted until the 3rd/4th wearing.<br /><br />The pads definitely help with adding airflow between the mask and the face, so looking back, I would use a stronger adhesive to adhere them pad to the mask.

5.0,Potent and Powerful - The Real Deal in Fish Attractants,"Being an outdoor writer for the last 15 years, I have been fortunate to try a lot of fish attractants that are out on the market. Some worked. Many failed.<br />For the last two months I have been testing the Liquid Mayhem scent by Rage Fish Attractants. First thoughts? Potent. The smell is the real deal. This can only help in attracting fish initially, but more importantly, making them hang on to your bait longer.<br />My favourite quality about this new scent? Adhesion. Unlike sprays that wash off after the first cast, this gel scent is thick and remarkably adhesive. Ten flips with a jig and the scent is still evident on the jig. Compared to other products, the effectiveness - and longevity - will outlast the competitors out there.<br />My recommendation is to give this stuff a try. Your confidence level will go up - as will your catch rate.<br />Good Fishing,<br />Justin",[],B00KNCUCEE,B0B6Q673W9,AFWWAM5Z3GBQRUNJF3EYY4W7URGQ,1404900725000,7,False

In addition, the straps are so comfortable and the pack is so compact that it feels as if the pack isn't even on when you are wearing it (when loaded with 10 lbs, although I am sure you could achieve nearly the same result with much more in it).<br /><br />In terms of pockets, it has on outer pocket on the back for a hydration bag (hydration bag not included, but it is easy to get an inexpensive one on amazon), a larger first pocket with a sub pocket on one side of it, along with a mesh sub pocket on the other side (this main pocket could easily hold a laptop), a middle pocket that is slimmer than the rear pocket (could also hold a laptop/notebooks), a smaller front &#34;sunglasses&#34; pocket (I use it for sunscreen), and a medium pocket on the front that has a few elastic/small pockets to hold a flashlight, pencil, etc. These pockets can all be made slimmer by 2 adjuster straps along the bottom and side, and can be secured by a buckle that runs along the front of the pack.<br /><br />The straps are padded and have loops to hold either the hydration pack's nozzle or other round things. It has multiple adjusting straps to allow for maximum customization and comfort, and has a chest and hip strap to hold it in place while on the move.<br /><br />All in all this is a great pack, and I would recommend to anyone who does lots of hiking, or a student who is looking for a comfortable, compact backpack.",[],B00F54A3TY,B00F52J766,AEDQCKOL7TUBXHE7MEM347FNSUTQ,1403823647000,3,True

4.0,my new bed,"i have bought some really expensive beds over the past few years and i have done much research to get a good bed. i have not succeeded. so i decided to go with this. TPU does not stretch as many commented on and so it stays inflated. i put a foam 2"" topper on top of this and it's like a regular bed, but i think it is better. yes the inflator pump sucks but it does the job. i am not going back to a normal bed. just have to dial in the air pressure now for the ideal feel. i wish i had not spent all that money on the last bed. worth noting that the size can be an issue when fitting sheets. it's in between double and queen size. consider jersey sheets in double since they stretch.<br /><br />update<br />ok so the negative vote i got made me think and i realize most of the review is about how regular beds suck and not how this bed is awesome, so time for an update. one of the great features i already mentioned, no stretching or leaks so the bed stays firm. another good feature is the connections inside the bed. the system they use allows for a fairly flat surface because the seal points are not form top to bottom but have a linkage that allows the bed to inflate to a fairly consistent depth across the surface. the image shows it well. other air beds have deep pockets where the weld connects the top to bottom piece. that is a major deal if you have ever slept on an airbed like this. flat surface is key. this bed seems to have the most advanced welding. the only real issue i have is that the bed is so light weight that it moves around easily on the frame. that can be annoying. Costco sells this same item and i sell to Costco so i know how intensely they review items for consideration to sell. this is the best airbed on the market today, period.",[],B00CWZE642,B00CWZE642,AEQI3L2S3455ISUYQ2NUN2RJSCOA,1400183821000,26,True
2.0,Updated review - Broke on second use,"Update - 2/1/2023: On the second use of this umbrella one of the inside pieces broke off and now I have your typical broke umbrella that has a droopy side. I can assure you I was NOT in hurricane-force winds at any point during the light rain I needed this umbrella for. I honestly thought this umbrella was going to be different but now I can no longer recommend this product especially at the price point they are asking for. It still gets two stars for the nice picture inside, but that's all it deserves for lasting only two uses.<br /><br />------<br /><br />This umbrella works great so far - but full disclosure I definitely have not been in hurricane force winds or any crazy storms to be able to report if the ""superior"" and ""unbreakable"" portions of the posting are accurate...but it feels pretty darn sturdy. As one customer alluded to - it takes a bit of muscle to close it completely after pushing the button to collapse the umbrella. However, I typically use the floor to close my umbrellas completely opting to remain as dry as possible - but understand it could be difficult for someone who is weak, young, or elderly. The design is very vibrant and the colors are great to look up at while listening to the rain. However, I will say that that posting was not very descriptive on what this design actually was and I did not even notice the tiny school of fish depicted in the water - so just be aware that the one photo in the posting does not show off the full photo. I'll try to get a picture the next time I have it open to add to the posting to share with everyone. Overall it feels very durable and the look and feel of this umbrella are great - it's definitely my go-to umbrella now.",[],B0BNJ323QT,B0BNJ323QT,AGSNR37FLSXIFU7VQDO44MTW6Y7A,1673403079016,0,False

I now use it on my surfski  in the Pacific ocean and no the salt water doesn't bother it any more than the muddy water. It still looks new. One complaint its too thick must have been a different leash. One complaint too long, well yes it may be, So wrap the clip end around something to shorten it. Might I caution you if you fall out in the ocean that extra length can allow the paddle to float out of your way when you reenter the boat, and if you are dragging your kayak along the shore or the boat dock that length is beneficial.

5.0,"LOVE these sunglasses, EXCELLENT customer service!","I don't usually write a review, unless I've had a really bad experience. Or a really good one. This review is because of the excellent customer service I received after I broke my sunglasses.<br /><br />I purchased these glasses in November 2017 as one pair among many, searching for the right pair for running. Here's what I loved about them: They are lightweight, they stay in place on my face despite the jarring motion of running (even stayed on when I tripped and fell once!), the red lens is truly red, the clarity of vision is outstanding, and they give me clear vision, with an unobstructed view. They are very lightweight. Plus, I think they would fit a wide range of faces, just from the design. I have a smaller, narrower face, and the glasses sit very comfortably on my face. I believe someone much taller than me would find them comfortable, too.<br /><br />The *only* negative is, when I'm wearing a hat, and the temperature outside is around 48F (a cool day for Seattle), they tend to fog up when I start my run. However, I'm sure a good anti-fog wipe would probably take care of that. I may experiment with that later.<br /><br />Last week (August 2019), I actually broke the frame while backpacking. I had put them in a pocket as I had done many times. This time, I don't know what I did, but I must have really crushed them.  I emailed Torege through Amazon by looking at my Orders and clicking the link for them. I asked if that was covered in their frame policy, and they said YES! I sent them a picture of the break, and they sent me a brand new pair of glasses, extra lenses and all!<br /><br />So, YES, they stand by their warranty. I love these glasses, and I'm super happy to get a new pair under warranty.",[],B01HRJIG3Y,B019JR5AMW,AEJWKMITGV5DV3KHACFE4FDPOD5Q,1566057136896,0,True

Tanks are expensive - whether you are the pentagon or a Yetti lover, why not get the biggest bang for your buck.<br /><br />The tank is great for parties too, no more multiple coolers and no more raising lids.

The rubber/foam upper rod clasps seem very cheap. I’m worried that they will fail in time and you have to be pretty gentle in prying them open. I feel like this should be $25 as-is, but would have paid $50 for a little better quality. This is only 13-14” around, so it doesn’t take up much more space than a floor lamp. I turned most of my reels into the center and was able to fit 9 ultra-light and bass bait caster rods no problem skipping about every other position.

3.0,"Regretted buying this set, despite high reviews","We decided to buy this one before heading down on vacation. First day I used it for only 5 minutes and it worked great. Second time in the water the mask started to fog up despite the ole spit and rinse technique that has worked fine with old sets. I also had the mask start to lose the seal several times while out in the water, which is touch to fix while treading water with sand shoes on. I had to come in quite a few times just to dump water out of the mask and readjust the snorkel.<br />The snorkel clip I feel is a terrible design. It's hard to get onto the mask and easy to fall off of the mask. I took the mask off once or twice in the water to adjust and the snorkel came wright off. Then I had to swim back to shore to clip it on because it's just too hard to do while trying not to step on coral.<br />The snorkel did function very well while on the mask. I dove down a couple times and it was super easy to blow water out. Water didn't come through the snorkel once. One way valve works perfect. Still, for the leaking and the little bit of fogging and especially for the hassle of the snorkel coming unclipped, I would not recommend this product unless you are snorkeling in an area where you can easily stand up to keep fixing your mask.",[],B001QBJRTM,B09WS3T4F8,AHV4QEYV4S5X36NG6ALIW6VYQZBQ,1337963276000,4,True

5.0,I am enjoying the Joust dartboard a lot with my family.,"This is my first dartboard and my family and I are really enjoying it. I should have bought a dartboard many years ago as a dartboard is cheap and can provide a ton of hours of fun. I easily put it together and I built an outdoor dartboard stand out of spare wood that I had. It looks great and we all play outside (I bring the dartboard inside when not in use). The board has very nice quality, cool ""marble"" design and I like how it has the movable number ring as I rotate to prolong the life of the dartboard. The provided darts aren't going to be expensive super high quality because that will greatly increase the dartboard price and make it tougher to sell. The darts work perfectly fine for me even though the feather falls out sometimes on bounce outs. I don't know if that is a normal thing with darts or just these darts. I notice that the softer a person throws or lobs the dart, it has a higher chance to bounce off a metal part. When I throw with a decent speed, the dart will have higher chance to stick in the dartboard even after it hits the metal. Speed matters. Lot of the kids are missing the dartboard completely and dulling the darts' tips so I am going to let them use these provided darts and I am going to purchase a nice expensive dart set in the future just for my personal use. Plus it would be nice to have another darts set for more players and I think I am going to need a sharpener too to keep the darts in shape. Great dartboard and I highly recommend it.

4.0,"Pretty nice looking, cheap, little lantern","I decided to get this lantern for my 3-years old nephew because I liked the looks of it over all the other more expensive ones.  The product shipped directly from China, but I don’t mind where the product is from so long as it works, and it’s cheap, only $4.64.  I ordered the product on 1/1/2014 and received it on 1/13/2014, sooner than I thought, fast shipping considering it came from China.  The size of the lantern, from the base to the top, not including the handle, is exactly 5.5 in, the diameter of the base is exactly 3 in, it’s perfect for my little nephew to play with.  There is a built-in simple-looking compass on top, not sure if it works, but it looks nice with the lantern.  The 12-LED lights are pretty bright at maximum, it will light up the inside of the tent.  It’s bright enough for casual reading, but because the light is slightly bluish color, it might strain your eyes if you do a lot of reading.  It’s good to have around the home when there is power outage, or use it to light your way in the dark.  Hopefully it will last a long time, only time will tell.  Overall, I like this lantern.  If you are looking for a small, very cheap, nice looking lantern, I think you will be satisfied with this one.",[],B00A3OC00G,B00A3OC00G,AGE7W2OC3EBTWLCGJPE766CG4PYA,1389690625000,0,True

It seemed sturdy and heavy enough to do the job; however, I was unable to test this aspect. Because of the rust, I decided to return it and began taking it apart to get it back into the box. I suggest examining all the pieces thoroughly BEFORE you begin assembly.  While assembling the rack isn't difficult, it will take about 45 minutes, so don't invest the time until you check the product. I liked this dumbbell rack enough to reorder it.

5.0,"Excellent regulator - superb comfort, performance and value for money","I bought this reg in late 2007 or Q1 2008 after having dived with rental gear - largely Scuba Pro, previously.

It competes with regs that come at a higher price, and while I did not have the budget I would have wanted then for a reg, and now comfortably do, I see no need to switch.<br /><br />I made the right choice. The GT3 performs well, I've had it serviced twice in 4 years and have had no issues. It breathes well at just about any angle you could find yourself at in the water, and I've fiddled around quite a bit just to determine that. Should I break it or lose I would buy the Oceanic Eos, however this reg is going strong and I have no need to replace it.

The blue light will not press flush to the walls of your boat due to it not being flat at the points where you screw in.  With the help of Dremel, I sanded those points down quickly enough and could proceed forth with the wiring.  It has only been a few weeks after installation now and the screws are rusting!  I live over an hour from the closest saltwater so the only solution is that these are just some of the cheapest screws ever manufactured.

2.0,Falls apart after a few months,"I liked this balance board's action; it's one of several I have and use daily. It consists of two separate parts: the flat board, and a hemisphere that rocks and rolls on the floor as show in the picture. The hemisphere has a short dowel-like protrusion that fits into a shallow hole in the bottom of the board. Both are glued together. Unfortunately, the dowel on mine is slightly longer than its insert hole is deep. Hence, the flat side of the ball cannot really seat onto and evenly touch the bottom of the board as it is supposed to do, . Eventually, with use it naturally breaks loose from the board. The ball itself did not break, but I had to spend twenty minutes in the shop scraping and cleaning off the extremely hardened glue and shortening the dowel, then  regluing and reattaching the half-ball, seated properly and clamped. Now forces applied to it will be spread across the ball's entire flat surface -- as it was supposed to do.

5.0,Great economy bar,This bar is probably a little bit better than what you would expect to get for $100. One of the best econ bars I have used. It is being used in a commercial gym and so far we have had positive feedback from our members. The knurling is medium to aggressive which is perfect for most people. As you would expect the knurling wears pretty quickly where the bar rests on the equipment. (see pictures after about 4 weeks use) We have not had the bar for long enough to really put it through the paces and see how well it holds up over time. The most amount of weight I have seen on the bar is a little over 500lbs. For the time being the bearings feel pretty smooth so you get a good spin. It does seem to have a little bit more whip than some of our other bars.

Since then many more of my clients use these bands.

The transitions are fast and easy. The ankle strap is comfortable. If there was any complaint, it's that the door anchor is 3 plastic beads that you put under the door or at the top of the door. If you have any appreciable gap in the top or bottom of the door, pulling the bands could make the anchor slip or come out. When we need to anchor to a door, we use my anchor which uses a donut ring instead and holds without slipping. I hardly feel that is worthy of docking a star as it is not the construction of the bands, but rather the house causing the problem.<br /><br />I would highly recommend these bands (and do to my clients, regularly). I'd just make sure where you are anchoring it has a very solid connection and no extra gaps.",[],7245456313,7245456313,AF7W6VXCR7O64PE2WBRE5LSKA25Q,1397061525000,1,True

3.0,"On SP101, only for those very handy or gunsmith install. Sight paint is an alternative.","While fiber optic sights work well and improve the sight picture in adequate light, on the Ruger SP101 revolver this is not an easy ""drop in"" installation, because a very tight roll pin must be driven out and a properly-sized small hole precisely drilled perpendicular in the sight itself.<br /><br />You must have very good shop skills and the right gunsmith tools to install the sight, or you can very easily permanently damage your expensive gun and also ruin the new sight. In particular, a 1/16"" roll pin punch with a little nub on the end is needed (like in the set sold by Lyman). A regular punch will just distort the end of the the roll pin and ruin it. Then you have to drill the precise hole in the new sight; if you are off just a bit or the hole is canted, it will ruin the sight. For the time and money, I'd just have a gunsmith install it. It's a short, inexpensive job for any competent gunsmith. It is better to also see if your gunsmith can order this sight. Then the smith can also make a few bucks on the sight, rather than you briging in the sight you purchased somewhere else.<br /><br />The back of the sight is vertical, not a ramp like the SP101 front sight, so it can hang up on the draw from a fanny pack, a purse holster, a pocket, and any soft holster that does not have a rigid sight channel. That's why the front sight is a ramp on guns made for concealed carry.<br /><br />Unlike a metal blade front sight, the fiber optic sight tube cover and the tube itself can be damaged if they hit against a hard surface with some force.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the fiber optic ""dot"" may not be exactly the same height as the center of the stock Ruger front sight ramp, so you may have to adjust your aim slightly to compensate.",[],B00173IZ74,B00173IZ74,AH44U6BCJVRATAUKZ7CKOK7T3MDA,1408354336000,4,False

After opening the box, I took it out and it was a beautiful teal color that looked very high in quality. 100% silicone covering, odor free and stainless steel detail was really nice. So I decided to give it a try. I wasn't planning on a workout so I decided to fill it with ice water. I placed the bottle on my counter, dropped a few ice cubes in, and filled it with water. All of the sudden, water was everywhere. Leaking from the bottom. I lifted up my bottle to find the glass had broken when I dropped the ice in!! I was so disappointed! Was I in the wrong for using ice I though? But I use ice all the time in my regular glasses. I am trying to figure out if this was a freak accident because I really wanted to like this brand.

3.0,"Good bag, but could improve","Last November, I took this bag with me to Japan for 10 days to test it out, and I did find some features in the bag that were inconvenient or could be improved. Firstly, I wished the main big zipper would fully open like a normal suitcase, or open a bit further down so i can access the bottom of the bag with ease. Even with my bag laying flat on the floor, I had slight difficulties reaching for my shoes and some clothes from the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />Second, it would be more convenient if the waist belt could be tucked in/stowed away somewhere when you decide not to use it. When I was at the KIX airport, the immigration line was incredibly long and I had my bag as a carry-on (at that point, i realized it was a mistake to not have it checked-in). Standing in line was grueling. I took my bag off my shoulders because it became uncomfortable, but as i was carrying it with my hand and also laying it on the ground, the straps just kept dangling around and were all around the place.<br /><br />Lastly, the size was pretty big. I'm 5'2 and I got the small/medium size because i read reviews that it could fit petite women, but i sure did look like a turtle walking around Japan.<br /><br />The PROs for this bag were, it has a lot of compartments to organize your belongings, it did fit as a carry-on on my trip (worked for United Airlines) and it comes at a reasonable price. However, in hindsight, I probably would've invested a tad more for a different backpack like the Osprey, Tortuga or Minaal (or maybe even stick with the Kelty but get the 40 or 44 Liter size).",[],B009R6B6IS,B009R6B6IS,AHBWXKT5BXHSC2MUAIVCR4GXV47Q,1450614388000,5,True

3.0,"A decent pedometer, that's more or less it.","This device has been useufl in confirming the obvious, but that is about it.  All in all, it's comfortable and looks nice, but I don't find it that useful.  I'll explain.<br /><br />Essentially, without the heart rate monitor, it is a pedometer, which will also loosely track time spent sitting or inactive.  I have a hunch the pedometer overestimates steps, too, and I have also confirmed it records &#34;steps&#34; when you use your arm in a movement, such as typing or clapping.  That is a major negative.<br /><br />This device confirmed the obvious for me:  when I find 20-30 minutes to use a cardio machine of some sort, or walk/play outdoors, I meet my 10,000 step daily target easily, and exceed it.  When I don't, I miss it, because I have a relatively sedentary job.<br /><br />I haven't found much more use beyond that.  As others have noted, the website and app don't provide that much interaction or data analysis.  I guess if you're motivated by looking at the band and realizing you are under target, that could be useful.  But like I wrote, after a few weeks of wearing it, you realize what you need to do during the day; you'll either do it, or you won't, and in my opinion, the band doesn't add to that understanding.  It might help psychologically motivate some people, though.<br /><br />All in all, it's a decent device, but I wasn't blown away.  I can't see myself wearing that heart monitor strap, either (which is also fairly pricey), especially when most workout machines have the heart rate monitor function built in.",[],B00FEQ6TVO,B00FEQ6TVO,AFISQVMFNIG2GQF2Q4GYIXFZTSFQ,1422179476000,1,False

3.0,Really hard to inflate by mouth,"My husband and I found this pillow impossible to inflate until we took a small, thin nail and punched holes in the area at the base of the mouthpiece, inside of its tube, right where it leads into the interior of the pillow. Inexplicably, the manufacturer had not left this area free and clear, so no air could get through! Even after punching the holes, it was still a pain to inflate, and it is not something I will want to do very often.<br /><br />This was a big disappointment to me. I need lumbar support when sitting on hard chairs, but it is a hassle to carry around a small pillow everywhere I go. I had hoped to use this as a portable pillow that I could take with me uninflated in my purse and blow up at will. So much for that plan!<br /><br />In terms of being an effective lumbar pillow when it is inflated, however, this pillow is actually quite decent. And as expensive as most lumbar pillows are, this one is a real bargain if used in that way.<br /><br />You might want to be aware that this product emits strong PVC fumes, and I recommend airing it out before sleeping on it in an enclosed space (if using it when camping, this would be less of a problem).<br /><br />You will definitely want to put a pillow case over this pillow if you are going to cushion your head with it. The feel of a plastic surface, whether smooth on one side or ""flocked"" on the other, is not enjoyable to press your cheek against. Not only that, it is rather hard and inflexible for a head pillow.

5.0,Modernized traditional diving mask.,"Earlier this season I got one of the new snorkel mask all in one deals. I really liked it until my first dive under the surface. The mouth area filled with water, and unlike a normal snorkel, where you can blow the water out the snorkel with a purging blow of air, I found myself panicked until I could get back over the surface and remove the mask to take a breath. I decided to go back old school. This liberty mask is a little bit of an update however from my regular skin diving days as a kid. For one thing the nose is separated from the faceplate, reducing the fogging of the lens. But best of all, and why haven't they always been this way? the side rubber of the mask is clear which gives you a much better peripheral view, so you can know when to turn your head to look face on to the interesting thing you peeked.

3.0,Callaway is onto Something… Incremental Improvements,"Bought this because of the “Compression Fit Golf Glove” tag line which is intriguing to me a someone who wears compression gloves most of the day and while asleep for chronic inflammation in my hands. I also had one of the original models from a few years back prior to developing the inflammation condition. TLDR is that despite the other reviews whining about it being so much better, this is an improvement. There’s a reason it’s 4 years old and I still use it, and that’s because it was never a secure and stable enough fit to use for anything but the short game.<br /><br />These aren’t quite at that level of compression, but they’re close. I genuinely think if Callaway were to be just a little bold and go out on a limb and add just a small amount of ergonomic padding like seen in the Bionic PerformanceGrip Pro gloves and have these fit more like a true compression glove that these would become far more popular than they probably realize. I’m 31 and in better than average shape and I would exclusively use that sort of glove if it existed, at least a few pairs per season.<br /><br />Full disclosure, I’m returning this because, as you can see in the picture, it tore at the seam near the thumb. I’m chalking this up to an uncommon manufacturing defect, but I have no way of knowing that. I had it for two days before that appeared and only used it to compare with my Bionic glove while putting inside my house.<br /><br />After this trial period and overall liking it much better than most other golf gloves, I still won’t be asking for a replacement with my return simply because while the feel is a bit better than that of my Bionic PerformanceGrip Pro, the support feels extremely lacking by comparison. If the compression were truer to that of say a Copper Fit compression glove, that would make up for the padding support difference most likely. Unfortunately it falls a bit short in both aspects.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1qe5mMpXtS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1qe5mMpXtS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1qe5mMpXtS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C19YubICbFS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C19YubICbFS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C19YubICbFS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1KCpUnpl6S._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1KCpUnpl6S._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1KCpUnpl6S._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07KWSG8R5,B09LDFRC24,AHWDTVVFEETY3FARDI2RT3PX5EIQ,1626390376219,2,True

Normal pellets come packaged in metal tins (at least in my experience).  This assortment comes in a one piece plastic vacuum formed four section tray, each holding one type of pellet.  The problem is the cover for this tray is simply a flat piece of plastic taped to the tray.  Not very secure. I transferred the pellets to different containers to ensure I didn't accidentally dump them.  IMHO Benjamin could have done a better job on the packaging taking into account where and how these are used - no problem maybe on a range, not good at all in the field.",[],B007QTHPX8,B007QTHPX8,AF6JBCIPSNLUJPK2E3U7USY4UOPQ,1374502206000,0,True

5.0,Nearly Perfect,"I wanted to use the bag for awhile before writing a review. After using the bag for a month or more, I have found it to be nearly perfect. The Pros: There is a 33in and a 36in bag. I'm using the bag for roller hockey and the 33in bag is more than generous in size for all my gear. There are pictures in the details or on the GRIT website that do a really great job showing how the bag can accommodate all your gear. I would recommend that if you are using a chest protector to invest in the 36in bag it has that little bit of extra vertical space and would likely be the needed room to accommodate that piece of gear. The bag is set up ver well and while I though having my heavy skates in the top portion of the bag may be probematic from a tipping point, it has never been an issue. The shape of the bag lends itself to a very balanced stance and it is not very tipsy. The skate compartment is perfectly suited and adjustable to hold a helmet and your skates (even those of you with huge feet). The bag itself is akin to a locker on wheels, everything has a place and your gear can be very organized and ready for use. There are some velcro (tm) sections on the outside of the bag that seem out of place, but it is for attaching your gear (shin guards, elbow pads, etc) to the outside of the bag when you get home from a game or practice to let your stuff air-dry).<br /><br />The bag is made of top grade materials and fastners. It certainly seems worth the investment at a higher price-point than other hockey equipment bags. Given the opportunity to chose again, this GRIT bag would win again and again. I love it.<br /><br />The Cons: The roller wheels are a hard-solid plastic, that will likely wear fine and are likely a durable option. I would have preferred a urethane wheel. Also the wheel houseing is not maintaninable, meaning if the wheels get damaged or gunked up, you have no option to fix or clean. Beyond this minor issue the bag is nearly flawless. GRIT did a fantastic job designing a mobile locker that keeps your gear organized and neatly stored.",[],B00943MU2A,B00943MU2A,AEGUKPSVWIXFVR3JF7SRAEYW7DMA,1364928162000,2,True

It seems a little pricey, but it is a high-tech laser detection device, and I have already made up for the cost of ammo that I would need to shoot to make up for the practice I get here.  It seems to accurately register where I am hitting it.<br />Pros:  I can practice trigger pull/dry fire and get immediate feedback on how I am shooting.  There are two modes: shoot so many rounds, then see how you scored and display the hits, or timed rounds (5, 10 and 15 seconds).  I definitely see improvement in my shooting.  There are a variety of calibers<br />Cons: I would like another mode where your hits display immediately rather than when you hit the display sensor.  If you are a bad shot, you may have a hard time hitting display and reset, but then that is just more practice.  The target itself could be a little bigger, but as it is it suits me fine for close-quarters, inside practice.<br />There are additional targets you can buy to work with the same cartridges, to include small random-timed targets, and cans that flip over.",[],B00QYY4CJG,B09F9LRQBQ,AH4ERCVET7VIUNRX4LLMH5JGWQBA,1424473189000,14,True

4.0,I like the light,"I like the light, but I'm not satisfied with the brightness at the lowest (longest-lasting) setting, so I've been riding it at night mostly with the brightest setting, and only getting something like two hours of endurance on it. While this is enough for most of the night rides I do, it's still not a very long duration. The middle setting will be used if I intend to push the two-hour mark at night. The lowest setting may seem OK at first, but compare it to how far down the road you can see objects in your path between the low setting and the brightest setting and you won't want to use the low setting anymore.<br /><br />During the day I ride with this in the blinking mode. I believe it makes me more visible to cars that are thinking of turning in front of me from side streets.<br /><br />The mount does seem to rotate just a tad over time so that periodically I'll have to grab the light and straighten it out a bit. I could probably improve this a little by trying to pull the rubber strap one more hole before latching it, or putting some double-sided tape on the bar where I want the mount to go. It is at least quite convenient.<br /><br />Overall I think the light is what they say it is in the advert, so I have no complaints, and it is quite a decent light. I do wish the brightest setting lasted a little longer, but if it did it would probably be a bulkier light.

4.0,An Honest Review from an Electric Scooter Veteran,"I just bought one of these, and having owned a scooter company 20 years ago and having ridden a Currie Phat Flyer for the past 18 years (I kept five of them when I folded the company, and I'm down to 2 1/2 now), I wanted to add my review of the GXL Scooter....<br /><br />First, it seems like a well-made, semi-sturdy machine.  It was tough to get the handlebars into the slot for them, but with a little working it finally went in.<br /><br />I run in the morning pushing a scooter and holding my dog on a leash with the other hand......and after a mile or two I jump on the scooter and give the dog some real exercise!<br /><br />First, I know weight is a factor......and 31 instead of 43 pounds (which my Currie was) makes a huge difference to me.  It's much lighter and easier to carry.  The downside to this is that because the motor is in the front wheel, it's ""front-heavy,"" and a little tough to push/run with.  You always get the feeling the rear tire is getting ready to flip up because the rear end is so light.<br /><br />As far as power, I weigh about 155, and this thing is pretty good on the roads around me.  Plenty of power to get up virtually all the hills I've tried (it's only been 3 days), and pretty quick on the straight-aways.<br /><br />I'm disappointed in its ability to run on paths.....either leave-covered or dirt.....as it's not great on either of these.  Maybe the fact that the front tire, although airfilled, is still very stiff, and doesn't dig into rough terrain.<br /><br />Lastly, I don't like the rear braking system, and wish I had known that for $10 more you can get the model with the handbrake.<br /><br />Other than that, it seems like a good unit, and so far so good.",[],B07F1GZM6Z,B07F1GZM6Z,AHPQVC3EDEUOFZEJ4GP5O2UWRNFA,1544388053557,0,False

4.0,Great for all uses,"I bought these before a trip to the coast. I used them indoors at hotel pools, outdoors at pools and in the ocean.<br /><br />They seal very well, I never had any leaking problems.<br /><br />They are very comfortable. I wore them for hours.<br />I really like the tinting. Indoors it takes the glare off of the water without making it too dark. I had no problem seeing inside and tended to forget I had them on. Outside it was really nice to have a constant pair of ""sunglasses"" on when I was in a pool or in the waves at the ocean.<br /><br />I have noticed some scratches on the front, so I don't think the tinting will last forever. So far it has not affected the vision. I don't know if the scratches are from while wearing or in storage. A bag to store them in and less rowdy children in the pool/ocean might be the answer to that.<br /><br />They fogged some days and not others. I do not know why. I speculate it has to do with water and air temperature and when I put them on and how often I take them on and off. When they did fog I just used a trick I learned from SCUBA. Spit on the inside of the lenses, swish it around, then rinse lightly in the water. That always works for my swim mask and it worked fine for my goggles too. I should probably try some anti-fog spray.<br /><br />The only complaint is the strap. I actually like the way it works a lot. It is very easy to adjust it to the length I want while wearing them.<br />However, it has come off twice so far. Fortunately never at an important time, but it does not give me a good feeling. It appears that the clip that holds the two ends of the straps together just slowly slides out continually. If you keep it adjusted too far out, it is going to pop off. Keeping at least a half inch out on each end keeps it form slipping off quickly. Then just remember to pull it tight every few days and it won't have time to slip off.<br />Several other reviews mention replacing the strap with a ""bungee"". I haven't found a place to buy those yet, but it might be the solution.<br />Fortunately they are dark colored and float to the top in calm water, so they won't get lost in a pool.",[],B002EOJWAO,B002EOJWAO,AGBTOBHIAVWJ3A7UIZW7RUREVDDA,1309431774000,0,True

Even though dimensionally this matched up with the sprocket on her bike, the original guard was attached by putting screws through the guard and threading them into the sprocket. This guard requires that screws go through the sprocket and then thread into the guard. This left the heads of the screws on the opposite side of the sprocket from the guard. Since the heads were so tall, they interfered with the chain. I had to remove the unit from the bike and won't be able to use it.

3.0,"Works, but better options unless you're pressed for roof space","Don't buy this unless you need it for the same reason I purchased mine for-- limited roof space. I originally had a more traditional Thule ski-snowboard rack, but with the addition of a Yakima Rocketbox, I had find an alternative that worked with half of my roof space, or swap them out every time I needed the other.<br /><br />Pros of this rack: Securely holds snowboards in place<br />Low price (for a Thule product)<br />Looks cool<br /><br />Cons: The straps are annoying, can fall off<br />Only holds snowboards<br /><br />To use the rack, you have to hook one end of the strap into the back of the E-- The higher end. There are four slots total for this, depending on the width of the boards you are carrying. Your snowboard(s) slot into the spaces, and the straps wrap over them, securing in the front. There are spacers in the grooves that move up and down, so that if you are carrying two different width boards, you can have them riding at the same height. Once the boards are in, You pull the strap down, open the gray plastic hatch on the front, slot the end of the cable in, close and lock it. Once this is in place, the boards are quite secure. I did have trouble with placing the straps being too tight on occasion. I would put my board in different orientations (four total ways), and as the bindings limit where the board can sit, and the board itself is wider at the ends than the middle, I had to establish that the board was going to ride THIS way and keep it constant.<br /><br />My main issue with the rack is the straps. It's kind of a hassle undoing them and redoing them every time. In addition, once I didn't bother to re-lock the straps down after taking my board inside. The next day I noticed in a parking lot that one strap was hanging only in the front groove, the other had disappeared. Locking them in place every single time is definitely the way to go, as without them the rack is entirely useless.<br /><br />All in all, I knew what I was getting. I knew about these problems, but this rack was the best option for what I needed, and thus earned my money. It's not the best design out there, but it gets the job done, and takes up hardly any space on my roof.",[],B0002XKI4I,B0002XKI4I,AHHC7D3Z5M47HJ3NZDEXUM3XDQTQ,1455938300000,4,True

What I thought would be an easy process using a pump turned out to be a 30 minute ordeal of my husband and I taking turns blowing the bag up and almost passing out in the process.  Turns out the trick to inflating the punching bag is to pinch the base of the air spout with the force of weight lifting champion and then pump air in.

5.0,"Expensive, but an easy job.","I changed the oil in my Alfine 11-speed for the first time today, after about 800 miles, or 1,300 km. of use.  It took me about an hour including oil draining time. My old oil looked dirty, but not cloudy or milky.  My hub had never been submerged.  My hub has seen extreme duty.  Instructions for the oil change come with the kit.  Plan on more time to drain the oil than the instructions indicate.<br /><br />A couple of thoughts:<br /><br />I put the bike in the house over night so the oil would be warmer than if it had been left outside in the garage.  (This job is probably best done on a hot summer day.)  I used the Shimano oil and changing kit, both from Amazon.<br /><br />I was unable to drain a full 25 ml of old oil out of the hub (in about 15 to 20 minutes and two full syringe extraction pulls I got about 20 ml).  Therefore, I decided to only use 20 ml of fresh oil for the cleaning &#34;rinse&#34;.  (The instructions say to use 25 ml, but I did not want the hub to end up over-filled.)  The oil came out almost as dirty after the rinse as the old oil did.  The rinse is definitely a good idea.  Of the 20 ml of cleaning oil rinse, I could only extract about 15 ml - again in about 15 minutes of draining and two syringe extractions.  I was pulling the syringe VERY slowly and stopping and starting the pulls, but would still get air bubbles.  When the syringe was pulled all the way out, I would rotate the wheel to put the port back on top, disconnect and empty the syringe and then collapse for a second go-around at sucking oil.<br /><br />I then put in 25 ml of fresh oil.  This went smoothly.<br /><br />Some say to super glue the tube to the syringe tip, but I did not find this necessary.  The connection never slipped or leaked.  In fact, I never had so much as a drop of oil escape the system.  I did have a rag handy to wipe off the tip of the tube after immersing it on the fresh oil when it was sucked into the syringe.<br /><br />I found the job very easy to do.  Shimano's prices are exorbitant, but at least I can now make the change next time by only purchasing the oil.",[],B005G0BG52,B005G0BG52,AG4WCJVWVXZB54NAUELXIGK2SPNQ,1414862416000,5,True

5.0,Solid as a ROC,I was skeptical about getting an inflatable paddle board. I read reviews for weeks on the ROC board and thought for $200 I might as well give it a try. Im so glad I did. This board was so solid and stable on the water. It was my first time on an ISUP and I never got wet. If you are up in the air on getting one Stop questioning and just do it. I had a blast on the water and cant wait to get back out there. ROC is the way to go for price and quality.

4.0,Good for physical therapy,"I bought the set in order to continue to do certain exercises recommended by my physical therapist, and it works reasonably well for that purpose.

5.0,WOW!! Really Impressive Pack!,"When I unboxed this backpack, my first thought was about how well made it felt. It is put together solid and has a really nice camo pattern(Next Camo G2) that looks a lot like RealTree Edge. It fits comfortably, has adjustments to fit any body type, plenty of padding on the straps and frame when when you have it loaded and heavy, and seems to distribute the weight well across the shoulder straps and waist strap.<br />There is an adjustable area between the frame and main pack compartment that can be expanded to carry larger items or used to pack out your game after the kill. It's large enough to accommodate a full size shooting mat and full ghillie suit and set of rain gear. I'm sure you could get 50 lbs of meat in it and with the rigid frame, adjustable straps, and enclosed bottom there would be no problem securing it for the pack out.<br />The smallest front compartment is large enough for several smaller items like multi-tools, calls, fire-starters, ect. It has a zippered pocket inside that has a clear face for any permits, tags, or other paperwork. The next compartment is deep and goes all the way to the bottom of the pack. It has a nice organizer made into the back of the pocket with lots of pockets for small items that won't get lost in the bottom of our pack. The middle of the pack actually has a pass-thru design that will allow you to carry a regular profile hunting rifle through the middle of your pack with a velcro strap to tie it down so it doesn't bounce around. It has a zipper at the bottom that allows you to close this pocket and use it for additional storage if necessary. The large main compartment has tons of storage. I've got a climbing harness, extra batteries, a couple of extra knives, wipes, 30' of 5/16"" rope, 2 days worth of snack foods, thermos, and two extra base layers and still have plenty of room to add more. I've only used it as a day pack, but I wouldn't have any problem getting enough in it for a two or three day outing. It extends all the way to the bottom of the pack and is about 7"" wide. It also has a pocket in the back of the compartment for a large hydration bladder and a small access hole for the drinking tube.<br />The fabric is sturdy and quiet. No noise as you walk through the woods and even when it brushes against something it stays quiet. Even the zippers are quiet allowing you to open and close your pack with minimal noise. The zippers have nice pulls with cord and a plastic grip and are sewn in well. The buckles, while they're plastic, seem to be sturdy and well made. There are a bunch of them, but all the straps allow you to configure the pack however you like. All the straps have elastic bands that allow you to fold the extra strap and secure it so there are no loose straps hanging off your pack to catch on limbs as you walk through the woods.<br />The waist strap has a small zippered pocket on each side. I carry a range-finder in one side and crossbow cocking rope in the other. They are very handy for range-finder sized items that you might want to access without removing the pack.<br />The pack is also set up to carry a rifle, bow, crossbow, or other items. It has two straps on the outside of the pack and an adjustable pocket that tucks away in a small zippered compartment on the bottom of the pack to carry the weight of your rifle or bow. I tried it with both my crossbow and a full size AR10 (airsoft of course. LOL) and it carries both well.<br />There are two bottle or thermos carriers, one on each side that will hold a one liter bottle or thermos.<br />The pack seems to shed water fairly well. I used silicone water proofing before taking it to the field, and in light snowfall and light rain all my gear stayed dry. It does include a rain fly which tucks away in the bottom of the pack in a zippered pocket. It is attached to the pack with a elastic strap that keeps it from getting lost, misplaced, or pulled off when you're walking through thick brush.<br />Overall, I'm really impressed with the design and the build quality of this pack. Granted, it's not a KUIU or Badlands but it's also only 20% of the cost. If you need a two day pack and don't want break the bank, this definitely fits the bill!! Tidewe did this one right!!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713tIxoWJpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713tIxoWJpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713tIxoWJpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71OviAsTimL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71OviAsTimL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71OviAsTimL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aX6desCtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aX6desCtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aX6desCtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gXe3Hk+9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gXe3Hk+9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gXe3Hk+9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lptxSM0GL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lptxSM0GL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lptxSM0GL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/815w6CDb3dL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/815w6CDb3dL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/815w6CDb3dL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8177paem4+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8177paem4+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8177paem4+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81CXhdCEX1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81CXhdCEX1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81CXhdCEX1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81EqKvuKyBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81EqKvuKyBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81EqKvuKyBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81knTCrmJwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81knTCrmJwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81knTCrmJwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nMBAlDM8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nMBAlDM8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nMBAlDM8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sNnNiYTPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sNnNiYTPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sNnNiYTPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B7BCG545,B0BGX97T3Q,AFBIYWVKQ34YH74SCSJ6TJABNW6Q,1668797042662,3,False

4.0,Seem to be of good quality. Might be a tad short.,"I got these recently and tried them out just once, so I can't say much in terms of lasting durability. I can say they seem to be well made and reasonably tough. They are described as being made of the same aluminum alloy as the popular MSR Groundhog stakes. I chose these over the Groundhogs because they came in a more suitable number (and, therefore, price) for my needs. I could only find the Groundhogs available in 8-packs whereas these are available in 6, 10, or 25-packs. I needed 11 stakes, so two 6-packs were my best option.<br /><br />These are definitely lightweight (about the same as the standard aluminum stakes that came with my tent (Marmot Pulsar), but the Y-shape definitely feels more stable in the ground. The edges are narrow, but not so narrow they will cut your hand or the loops and guylines they are intended to secure. The chord loops are nice pulling up stakes, but these loops could have been a little bigger, as I can only get one finger through it. As another reviewer stated, the blue color stands out well, so I'm less likely to accidentally leave one on the ground when packing up.<br /><br />I'm taking one star off the the rating, because I feel like the 7"" length is bordering on being too short. I'm using them for a small backpacking tent, but if I were using a larger tent that caught more wind, I'd prefer something a bit longer. The place I tested the stakes was on a sandy  tent pad, and even when I drove the stakes almost all the way in, some still seemed a little insecure. I think adding an extra inch or so would be beneficial for general use.",[],B00P2SDTLW,B00P2SDTLW,AHSDSNWU5TGSSQZ5APWJWJWRUPVQ,1423534123000,1,True

5.0,Sounding off,"[[VIDEOID:6f0b3e5d79f630208a36afe9e1097711]] I got this electric bike horn to use it on my electric scooter so that I wouldn't have to use the pitiful sounding preschool mechanical bell that came pre-installed on it.<br /><br />This electric horn is small but powerful. Of course, this will not be as loud as a car horn or something like that but it will definitely grab someone's attention a few feet away to politely notify them to get out of the way!<br /><br />I absolutely love that this electric horn is rechargeable and that it also doubles as a alarm. Once set this alarm is very sensitive to motion and goes off almost immediately when any  kind of motion is detected.<br /><br />The only things that I noticed as a weak point with the alarm function is that the alarm siren is relatively easy to deactivate and in addition to this the whole device is super easy to remove from the scooter handle. Because of these two things someone who is trying to steal my scooter could easily deactivate or quickly take off the device.<br /><br />In all fairness, though, this device is primarily a horn with the added benefit of also being able to function as a alarm so I can't be to harsh on it since it is not solely a alarm device.<br /><br />This little electric horn has turned out to be exactly what I needed. Something fun and easy to use but loud enough to grab people's attention when I am on the move.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/718wSIfzjmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/718wSIfzjmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/718wSIfzjmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09KMNRCW6,B09KMNRCW6,AFJIFR2LU2EE6V5PTZ4W6EA5CFTQ,1648361117056,0,False

5.0,2 super high quality positioning pillows.,"I wasn’t in the market for yoga bolster pillows, but the pictures were so beautiful I figured I could certainly find a use for them. I use these pillows to support my iPad or book when I’m reading in bed. I basically use them like a lap desk. They are lightweight yet very dense.<br />To test out its ability to keep its shape I sat on it for 15 minutes. It was firm yet comfortable, and it didn’t sink in.<br />Regarding the appearance and feel of the cover, it is luxurious! It kind of feels like suede. I looked over the description and it actually says it’s made of “eco suede” which I’m not familiar with. So I looked up “eco suede” and it turns out it’s polyester. It’s a vegan version of suede and is machine washable.<br />The stitching is professionally done and the zipper is well hidden. I wouldn’t hesitate to order more stretching and positioning products from this company because high quality items like this aren’t created by accident. I’ve received enough poorly made items lately to know when a product has come from a legitimate company that cares about making perfect products opposed to making products that barely pass as usable.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jAYVo+FnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jAYVo+FnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jAYVo+FnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sMHdm4LsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sMHdm4LsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sMHdm4LsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uImNgcXUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uImNgcXUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uImNgcXUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pAuPjeXzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pAuPjeXzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pAuPjeXzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BP1JCFGM,B0BRP4VM6M,AEFLOPTNRDFFFWLTGPR2VE5VO43A,1673585513526,3,False

5.0,A fantastic value on an extremely high-quality backwoods/camp knife,"This is an extremely high quality, tough, and well-built medium/large-size backwoods/camp knife.  It's bigger than your typical ""bushcraft"" knife, but smaller than a huge ""survival"" knife; I'd call it a medium-large size I suppose.  The D2 material in the very thick blade is extremely tough and holds an edge quite well.  The finger guard has a small hole in it, I'm not sure why, but between it, the curves of the handle, which is extremely grippy, and the jumping on the spine, you are able to get a really good grip on this knife.<br /><br />It has a lanyard hole at the butt where some low end ""paracord"" is loosely tied through there, though it is practically decorative and was promptly removed.  If you were to pick this up, I'd recommend you do the same, swapping it for a good quality piece tied well.  The Kydex sheath is ok, though truth be told I'm generally not a fan of those, and I started making a nice leather replacement already.  That being said, the Kydex is formed well and the knife locks in securely.  The belt mount attaches to one side only, though it does seem fairly secure, and that is necessary anyway to keep the sheath profile low.<br /><br />Overall, I feel like this is a fantastic value for a very high quality knife.  The blade is phenomenal and made with extremely tough material that holds a very fine edge well, and the knife itself is extremely comfortable to hold securely.  If you're looking for a strong backwoods survival/camp knife, look no further.",[],B0B8SGXGM1,B0BRXK7PJD,AH55RDCKO4VFJSNTEGFNKMOHUBPQ,1668710365707,1,False

I mean you just can't stitch the bottom of the pocket to the side of the pack, there's no room for the bottom of the water bottle!!!! You need material in the shape of the bottom of the nalgene bottle down there!!! Stitching right out of the box is undone, may return it, may sew it up myself, still poor quality.

2.0,only holds pen light,the leather is really nice and the holster seems to be well made. The multitool pocket is just the right size for most multi tools. the pencil pocket will hold a pen or pencil nicely. However the flash light pocket is just too small to be much of any use. it may be that the one I received was assembled or stitched wrong. The flash light pocket on the one I received is small and would only hold a small pen light or maybe a small light that uses a single AA battery like the old small mag lights. A lot of the reviews and answered questions made it seem that it holds a little larger light. I have several of the newer lights that uses a single 18650 battery and those lights will not fit in the holster I received.

Have backpack companies not realized that more people carry more weight around campus and to and from work then the hiking community? I was hoping this would be an urban hiking bag type thing.<br /><br />I will say that having the internal frame and using the hip belt is what I really wanted. I've always been attentive to my back and it was driving me crazy that I could carry 80 pounds for three week treks in the winter but my toes would tingle with 25 pounds of books. Distributing the weight correctly as if I were on the trail is what I was aiming for and this does provide that solution. Also, I didn't realize that the hip belt has a second advantage - I could tell one night a person was scoping me out to possibly grab my bag - there had been reports of that on campus is a quick series. When he saw the hip belt snugged to me he moved on - snatch-n-go wasn't going to work, although he was right I'd never catch him on foot haha.

5.0,"Great product - c'mon, buy it!","The Saris M2 is a wheel-on trainer. <br /><br />Originally it was the Cyclops Magnus and still shows up as the Magnus on ANT+ and Bluetooth, depending on what you are using.<br /><br />The Saris M2 comes packed well in a sturdy and neat little box.<br /><br />This box very prominently lets everyone know that you have just acquired a brand-spanking new bike trainer from Saris, so your mail/delivery person and your neighbors and friends and spouse and everyone will obviously be green with envy and jealousy over your new cycling purchase. <br /><br />Hopefully, porch thieves will not be.<br /><br />The box consists of two parts, the outer one slides into the inner one and is taped together, making it very secure and stable and protective.<br /><br />The main structure of the A-frame bike trainer is folded and secured in cardboard sleeves inside the inner part of the box and the roller/flywheel/resistance wheel and power pack (unlike non-smart trainers this unit requires power) and skewer are in a bag and secured in their own box inside the folded piping of the trainer structure.<br /><br />There are assembly instructions and a few other things like a one-month free membership to Rouvy.<br /><br />The Saris M2 also comes with a limited lifetime warranty, which is nice (make sure you register).<br /><br />Assembly of the unit is pretty straightforward and easily done with the included tools. One part gave me pause but it was my own issue - thinking I knew how the bolt SHOULD go in when I should have just followed the directions. It took a few minutes of assembly and it was ready to go.<br /><br />The process consists of bolting on the resistance unit and mounting the adjustment lever on the frame, and then the resistance clutch knob with a bolt. Easy for anyone to do.<br /><br />The legs fold out for use and back in for storage. Though I usually leave them folded out a bit so that it doesn't topple over when I store it. The two foot pads on the rear of the A-frame have leveling feet in case the surface you are putting in on leaves something to be desired in the level department, though the folding front legs give it a certain amount of self-leveling ability too. A quick turn of the knobs that make up the ends of the feet lets you increase or decrease it's level a bit. The structure itself is matte black painted metal, the whole thing weighs about 20 pounds or 9 kilos. It feels very substantial and heavy-duty. The rated maximum rider/bike weight is 300 pounds (140 kg).<br /><br />This is a magnetic resistance trainer so there are coils and magnets in a disc on one side, whereas the other side has a flywheel (with a cooling fan inside) with a roller in between. The skewer that comes with the Saris is of a common size and replaces the skewer that is already on the back wheel of your bike, it is easily replaced by unscrewing the existing one and replacing it with this one made especially for this trainer, tightening it. The ends of the skewer fit in perfectly to the nubs on either side of the trainer fork.<br /><br />To lock it in there is a lockdown level that has three positions for various skewer sizes ranging from 120 to 135 mm, and if you need to you can pick up skewers for other sizes from Saris or other companies..<br /><br />One of the hinges on one of the legs was a bit tight and very hard to pop out so I did have to get my socket set out and loosen it slightly, as the included tool only fit the parts that needed to be assembled. I also sprayed a bit of WD-40 Specialist Dry Lube onto the surfaces that touch each other where the legs hinge in and out. The WD-40 Specialist Dry Lube is great stuff, BTW, great on a good many things where you don't want petroleum-based lubrication and mess.<br /><br />The overall approximate size of the unit is around 21 1/5 inches (55 cm) wide and folds out to about 27 inches (69 cm) or so and folds to around 14 inches with a height being about 20 inches (51 cm).<br /><br />The flywheel itself is around two and a half pounds or 1.2 kilos and has a cooling fan inside it. I guess I am not putting in enough power as I never notice anything on the unit getting anything but barely warm! My other bike trainers had much smaller flywheels and resistance units and they got significantly warm, even hot sometimes.<br /><br />The Saris M2 can be used with most any common bike wheel size including 700, 26"", 27"", 29"", 650b and the trainer info shows that it can take up to a 2-inch wide tire, though there's plenty more room for more width so I am not sure why that is only up to 2"" (5 cm). The roller is aluminum and 2"" (5 cm), pretty standard.<br /><br />Max wattage is 1500 watts at 20 mph with a 15% inclined simulation. 1500 watts is a lot, and I think someone like me is never going to even come close to approaching this, on the non-smart bike trainers I have lying around here it is pretty easy to surpass their maximum power, at least for a time. <br /><br />Accuracy is + or - 5% but strangely the Amazon page for the M2 shows a +/-2% accuracy. But I believe that all other official ratings are 5% so the 2% is probably a mistake by whoever created the Amazon page.<br /><br />The sound level is supposed to be around 70 decibels at 20 mph (32 kph) but can be pretty loud if you are really putting a lot of power into it and are using just regular tires. There are a plethora of bike trainer tires of all sorts for all sorts of bikes that are going to decrease your overall noise level. But I just use an old tire from the previous season, on mine. Checking the level with a simple decibel meter on my phone seems to correspond to what Saris rates it as, maybe a bit higher. You can also decrease the sound level by using a mat or towel and other things, it really depends somewhat on what surface you have it on in addition to the above factors. Check out the video at the end of this post for a quick demo of the nominal sound level.<br /><br />The M2 uses standard Bluetooth and ANT+ FE-C for connecting to devices, this allows two-way communications so its sensors are read in one direction and in the other direction can control the trainer's resistance.<br /><br />Bluetooth is sometimes better and more stable than ANT+, which is what I have found as well as others. Though Bluetooth seems to only allow one connection but if you have other devices you can also use ANT+ at the same time.  Power, cadence and speed sensors are built-in and sent to whatever device you are using.<br /><br />Pairing is standard, quick, easy and no big deal (on phones and tablets you pair it in the app(s) that you are going to use - not with the phone's native Bluetooth pairing).<br /><br />Pair it to the Saris app first for calibration - Android version here and iPhone version here. Though I did have a weird issue with the Saris app at first, and I had to uninstall and re-install it at which point it quickly paired and I was able to jump on and calibrate it. Calibrating just consisted of a quick spooling up to speed and then letting it roll down. Done and over with. It also had a firmware update, which while taking a while was also easy and straightforward. This is also done on the Saris app - as always with any device; don't unplug it or mess with it while it is being updated.<br /><br />Also, note here that you may need Location turned on on your phone or tablet when pairing.<br /><br />Once it is calibrated you can then pair or connect it to other apps on your phone or tablet, to programs on your computer (make sure you have Bluetooth turned on or an ANT+ dongle), or to bike computers or your watch. Pairing or connecting to each device may be different but with all of the devices that I have connected to, it was done quickly and easily. This included my phone, tablet, computer, Garmin Fenix Watch, and Garmin Edge 520 Plus bike computer. The Edge and Fenix can run a number of training sessions that you set up in Garmin Connect, or be used to manually change the resistance of the trainer or keep you running at a particular wattage.<br /><br />The Saris M2 is a basic smart trainer and there is no rocking, no steering, no raising up of the front or back or anything like that, etc - you would have to get external equipment for simulating those options. And it won't simulate cobblestones or stones or brought pavement or anything like that. Some people do make their own rocker stands and such and as I said - there are many external devices you can use with it.<br /><br />I like to put a towel down under the trainer and bike, not only does it provide a little protection and cushioning but frankly you are going to sweat profusely so it is pretty necessary, even with a fan! And it can help dampen some sound. There are lots and lots of bike trainer mats too, that are made especially for bike trainers or you can get a generic fitness mat or a cushioned mat from Lowes or another home improvement store, or any number of things as needed.<br /><br />So to go over the procedure for setting it up - it's pretty easy.  Make sure your rear bike tire is pumped up to proper pressure and try to keep this pressure as exact as possible each time you use the trainer for consistency in power output. Just set the trainer down and fold out the legs, position your bike so the skewer ends line up with the nubs on the fork of the trainer and push the lever down and it's locked in. When you assemble the Saris M2 you do have to set the lever position to correspond to the width of your skewer/frame beforehand, which just takes a few seconds of messing with and once it is done you don't need to again.<br /><br />A riser under the front tire (as I said - the Saris M2 does NOT come with a riser but there are tons of them on Amazon. I even made my own out of wood), plug the power pack into the back of the trainer and tighten the pressure knob down. The tension knob is yellow and you just tighten it until it clicks - which sets it to the same resistance each time via an internal clutch. Ideally, you may want to re-calibrate at the beginning of a session and as conditions can change, but I tend to not as I am not quite training so intensively that I need exactly perfect accuracy. You may also be able to calibrate individually in various programs or apps that you are using.<br /><br />Whatever software are using - whether it is an app or a program or the bike computer; I found that it generally works smoothly and easily and with very little trouble. Occasionally you may have a bit of a setup the first time depending on the app or program.<br /><br />There doesn't seem to be much of a warm-up needed for the resistance to be stable, and as for the resistance changes themselves - they are smooth and pretty quick but not so fast as to be unrealistic.<br /><br />It is certainly not real quiet, especially when you are really pumping some watts into it. I have maybe mentioned this often here and I don't want my readers to think that it is overly loud - I would say it's comparable to the other bike trainers I have and only gets a bit louder because it is able to put up a higher resistance/power output.<br /><br />Depending on what you have under it for a mat or towel (I highly recommend one or the other) and whether you have a carpet, and how your house is constructed - it can be a bit loud on the upper end; though I could still hear the TV with a bit of a bump in the volume.<br /><br />Standing up and pounding out as much power as I can in a cardio-swamping hyper-sweat dripping sprint - the trainer is stable and secure underneath the bike; no wobble or instability. Whether you are just spinning, doing intervals, or standing up and pounding out some wattage it is smooth and stable through the whole range.<br /><br />The flywheel is a good size and its inertial felt pretty good for me, like during coasting and such. But I also came from smaller trainers with fairly small flywheels so this larger flywheel makes a lot of difference. The flywheel also has cooling fans inside. This brings me to the other thing I noticed - because of various things like the higher wattage capacity and maybe the flywheel blades and the fact that it is a heavier-duty unit overall - I rarely feel much heat being generated or retained by the M2. Maybe I just don't put that much wattage into it ;)<br /><br />With ANT+ I had a few dropouts on a couple of programs on the computer, but that was solved by switching to Bluetooth and that probably was more a matter of the old ANT+ dongle that I have than any issue with the trainer. The only other thing that caused a slight burp was certain user-created interval workouts in Kinomap - most worked fine but a few increased the resistance too much on my particular trainer, I am guessing this had to do with the people who originally created that particular user-created routine. This is a non-issue for me as Kinomap seems to have started abruptly charging a subscription for sharing to Strava or even downloading workouts, so I have abandoned this app for others, like Wahoo RGT. See below screenshot.<br /><br />There are lots and lots of apps and programs that you can use with the Saris M2 - including but not limited to Wahoo RGT, Zwift (the M2 is Zwift certified), Rouvy, TrainerRoad, Bkool, Fulgaz, MyWhoosh, Kinomap, Golden Cheetah (a super swiss army knife of training, but with a slightly steep learning curve and only for computers), TrainerDay, etc  Also, noted earlier but worth mentioning again - you may need Location turned on on your phone or tablet when pairing any of these.<br /><br />Some software allows you to use ERG workouts created with other programs and run them for interval and training workouts, and others like Garmin Connect allow you to create them yourself right in the website or app.<br /><br />So to sum up here and to conclude this review...the Saris M2 Smart Bike Trainer is a great trainer, well-made, works flawlessly and smoothly, and a good way to get a smart trainer for a reasonable price that doesn't break the bank. It's a couple of steps above a non-smart trainer in quality as well as features, comparable in accuracy to more expensive ones, and is quick and easy to set up and be training with little effort or trouble, and lets you use any major VR training or smart training app out there. Great product, buy it!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SlQUG4r-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SlQUG4r-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SlQUG4r-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51misR8a2BL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51misR8a2BL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51misR8a2BL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51yp83tvCTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51yp83tvCTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51yp83tvCTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61I-A1b2MUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61I-A1b2MUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61I-A1b2MUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LVqLLr8pL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LVqLLr8pL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LVqLLr8pL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aufXZKIGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aufXZKIGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aufXZKIGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71i-VxFf6nL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71i-VxFf6nL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71i-VxFf6nL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71m8+-mBASL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71m8+-mBASL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71m8+-mBASL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07WXDXCTH,B07ZGPF3F5,AHP2Y6ZTVWVBPNWNGMDCDB6YBNGA,1671743311474,8,True

Also, the first version of the HR Monitor watch came without the HR chest strap, but that was not explained, nor suggested, and it was included in the photo of the watch.

I can really dig and get much more workout per minute then without. I go at a much quicker pace until my body begs me to stop instead of taking a rest period because Im unable to catch my breath. The only draw back was the first session or two learning to not breath at all through the nose (the recommendation to wear a nose clip might be important to some who try this for the first time) which was no worse than a slight discomfort until I exhaled stongly through my nose to clear which I am very used to now.

I use them on a daily basis and I have 7 of them now with most of them being the most expensive popular brands you get from top outdoor stores.

The material is the finest quality and the clips much more durable and stronger than the others. They are also much easier to roll up when closing the bag. I’m in and out of the bags a few times per day and they have a much smoother rolling process.

This bag rolls up conveniently and easy and I don’t have to struggle with getting the position just right.<br /><br />I’m not knocking the other bags I have because they do a good job but these are better both in the quality of the material and the brackets and rolling process.

3.0,Rough handle,"I'm just starting out using kettlebells.  I'm 51 and have very little strength.  I decided to purchase a 12 lb and 15 lb bell.  I liked the idea of having a wrap around the bottom of the bell to protect my floor.  I read a lot of articles on the best kettlebells and the two highest rated was Rep Fitness and Kettlebell Kings.  However, they were very pricey and since I am just starting out, I didn't want to pay that much.  I purchased the 12 lb GYMENIST and the 15 lb Amazon Basics.  I'm going to compare both of them and hopefully this helps someone when considering future purchases.<br /><br />GYMENIST Pros<br />Neoprene Coating is thinner than vinyl coating (Amazon Basics) so when your fingers touch the neoprene it isn't as rough or as uncomfortable than the thicker vinyl coating<br />Cost (both Gymenist and Amazon Basics were comparable in costs - about a 1/3 of the cost of Rep or Kings)<br /><br />Gymenist Cons<br />Sharp edges on handle.  The black paint on the handle was chipped and there's a very sharp edge right on the side/center of the handle where you would naturally grip.  I could probably sand it down, but then that would further remove the paint.<br />Handle is thick.  The Gymenist is the lighter and smaller of the two kettlebells (12 lbs) but the handle is slightly thicker than the 15 lb AB kettlebell.  I feel like my hands are a normal size but I definitely prefer the thinner handle from Amazon Basics.<br /><br />I don't think I'm going to keep either kettlebell.  The sharp edges of the Gymenist and the uncomfortableness of the vinyl coating on the Amazon Basics just don't lend itself to using these long term.",[],B01M2BUFDX,B01MDTNETH,AGXDCLIARV7LUJVA5UDQKJFDLBYA,1562529095144,21,True

4.0,Good treadmill overall,"First, let me get the complaints I have about this treadmill out of the way, all of which are minor, but numerous:<br /><br />- When I'm walking or running on the treadmill, I get shocked every time I touch one of the metal parts. I had the tech from the local store I bought it from come out and verify that it's properly grounded. He called Lifespan, and they said it might have something to do with the environment, or the shoes I was wearing. Basically, 'we don't have a clue.'  The demo unit in the store doesn't shock me with the same pair of shoes on. I know this can be an issue with treadmills in general, so who knows if maybe the air is too dry or something in my apartment. Nothing that a little velcro on the metal rails can't fix.<br />- I don't like the speed/incline buttons on the side rails. I always end up pressing them on accident.<br />- As far as I know, there's no way to enter custom stats (such as weight and age) without having to install an app on a PC and transfer via the USB key. (Guess tablet-only users are out of luck.)<br /><br />Having said all that, I don't think it can be overstated how QUIET this thing is, which is why I like it. I was concerned whether or not having a treadmill in a 1st floor apartment would be loud enough to disturb the neighbors, but no such worries with this unit. It also works great with my Polar FT4 wireless heartrate monitor. The Polar HR monitor can be wonky sometimes, with sporadic readings that are all over the place, but that's not the threadmill's fault.<br /><br />There's an exercise program on the treadmill where you can input a target heartrate, and the treadmill will speed up or slow down, to keep your heartrate at the target you set. I hadn't heard anyone talk about this, so figured I'd mention it here. It actually works pretty well. It checks in about every 5 seconds or so (the manual says 10 seconds, but it happens more frequently than that), and will adjust the treadmill speed (or incline, whichever you specify) accordingly.<br /><br />All in all, despite the gripes I have with it, I still like it. I compared it next to a TR-4000i in the store (I uploaded a pic of them side-by-side), and ran on both. Other than the 4000's belt being longer, they seemed identical to me, so I'd recommend the 3000, unless you're over 6 feet tall. Also, if you want a tablet mount for this unit, check out the [[ASIN:B0072LASLQ B0072LASLQ]] as it fits very snugly. I uploaded several pics of it mounted on my TR-3000, on its product page :)<br /><br />One more thing to note - when I first got the treadmill, the LCD was almost impossible to read when standing right in front of it. Turns out that you can tilt the display with a couple of screws, and I had it tilted too far forward.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51K2NrmTqDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51K2NrmTqDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51K2NrmTqDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EmmWopzWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EmmWopzWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EmmWopzWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B002FJZLJY,B09DN8NVXN,AEQ6PEJKDUKRANPJXLU6B5TLZYBQ,1385362021000,145,False

This will definitely be my go to for home for a long time.<br /><br />The only reason I say this is a home cue instead of bar/pro is because it has a little bit of an uneven part on the front section right around the break area.

3.0,Screws that came with it don't fit,There were two sets of screws that came with it. One pair were too long and the others too short to fit in their places. I needed to buy screws and bolts with the correct dimensions. I used two 1/4in-20 x 2in and two 1/4in-20 x 2.5in screws and bolts. Everything fit together with the new screws but the bars weren't parallel after assembling and it looks like one of the metal L-shaped parts is slightly more bent. Without any weight on the bar the whole thing sits a little uneven on the doorframe. When I put my body weight on the bar the force pushes the rack into the proper position so I don't think the non-parallel issue will affect the performance and the pieces may get slightly bent into a parallel position if I continue to use it.<br /><br />TLDR: You will need to buy new screws that actually fit instead of the ones it is shipped with.

5.0,Good things come in small packages!!!!,"[[VIDEOID:7cc8c100271807b91002fcdea965688c]] With summer quickly on us there are things that me and my family do a lot that I don’t want to take a huge purse with me. One of those things that we do almost every weekend in the summer months is go to flea markets. With the Northern California heat the last thing that I want to do is carry a huge purse with me so this backpack is gonna be perfect.<br /> I was kinda confused when I opened the pack for the first time cause the way that it is you have to unzip the pouch and then turn the backpack inside out to get it to the proper way that it needs to be used. One of the things that I liked about this design is that the pouch that holds the pack turns into a cool pocket on the inside for extra storage, this is great cause I am always losing the little pouches for these things and this is great to have it all in one spot. This pack is nice and lightweight so there is no extra heaviness to carry. One of the things that is great about this bag is that even though the bag is smaller there are a lot of places that you can put stuff. In the front of the pack there is a mesh like pocket that is great to put a bottle of water in. In the part that will touch your back there is a great pocket that is great for cash and all your credit cards and ID’s, I love that this pocket is up against my back so that there for I feel a little bit more secure that my stuff is safe.  The packs strap is nice and thick so there was no discomfort when either me or my husband wore it.<br /> One of things that I also worry about with these packs is that there is always a problem adjusting the straps between me and him. I am 5 foot and he is 6 foot 5 and there was no problem adjusting between between me and my tall hubby. The pack is also easy to take on and off which hubby loved, the snap on the bottom makes it so there is no need to pull the pack up above your head.<br /> I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my true and unbiased opinion.

4.0,"Thank you, Awesome!!","I love it!!!  I can see how the gasket may get twisted if put in a dishwasher and such as some consumers have said, but they are of good quality and I don't see it as a finite issue.  Two easy solutions for that is check them before filling and wash by hand...<br />It's function design is effective and I have already used it with more than just citrus, but did pick this one for the citrus intent and purpose, whereas I don't think the other design would work well both ways.  I would give it the fifth star if the bottom (at least) was just a little bit bigger.  I know at this size it's meant to fit well in multiple cup holders and carriers, probably, but unless you use a smaller piece of fruit, you have to cut some of the outer rind to make it fit and hold it in the bottle for continued 'zinging' while filled/drinking from.  So I don't know the best way to do that but...wtv<br />You can find fruit infusers with other bottles but the citrus juicer and its design, and the slicer pieces on this one are way superior!  So far I have used it within its intentions but filling other bottles after its zinging process and refilling it to continue, so I have more cold infused water to drink when done with one fill volume.",[],B013UWYS4S,B013UWYS4S,AFIYVJQEXFTDN2OT5DBK4VR7VEQQ,1463210612000,0,True

5.0,This are Great Adjustable Weights,"I've worked out all my life since i was a teen and have gone from light weights to heavy weights and so forth to work different parts of my body using different class of weights from rubberised weights to metal weights. They all work pretty decent if used properly however thats the extent of the capacity does weights can do since injury is a high risk with them when not used properly. I just recently started working out again half a year ago to get back into shape. Sometimes using different weights and needing to buy different weight size can be a pain and cost way too much just to get a full set from 5-100 pounds or more which can cost over 1000$.  Which also brings me to another factoe the space, unless you have a large area to make as your own personal small gym, space will play a factor when needing weights to work out and increasing your strength. After looking through many types of weights and adjustable weights i came across 2 companies that made great adjustable weight sets, The Bow Flex 1090 and the Power Block Elite, at first i was aiming for the bow flex but after long consideration and many reviews and ratings i found that the bow flex wasn't for me since there where many issues with the bow flex. Althought the bow flex are definitely a great adjustable weight set of 90 pounds, they are not only a pain to change weight sizes but are also longer in lenght since the weights themselves are an attachment to the already long bar thats attached to the grip which makes them not idea for areas with small space or areas to store them. Another issue with the bow flex was the weight distribution, they arent even and a lot of the weight is held on one side when lifting them that you need to compensate with your wrist which would pose a big issue in the near future if continued use.<br /><br />Now for the Power Block Elites, this product had somewhat good somewhat mixed reviews but a lot of them were mostly good reviews and i also liked the fact that the weight adjustment was easier to use when it came to changing weight sizes. Unlike the bow flex which was alot faster to change weight sizes the big problem with them was the long bar which was attached to the grip. With the Power Block Elites the adjustment was fair at changing size weights and it also took getting used to inserting the weight handle pin to lock the weights in place. Once you got used to changing weights it became a breeze and with each change of weights the Power Block became smaller or bigger(bulkier) depending on the weights you wanted plus on every weight change the weight distribution was always even no matter how you held the weights. This was a huge plus which allowed me to hold the weights better and work even harder. Best part is that this blocks didn't require alot of space to store them or keep them in a small area. So lets go with the PROS and CONS of the Power Blocks.<br /><br />PRO's<br />*Power Blocks are great in small areas and large areas so storing them is great if you dont have the stand which includes working out.<br />*Working out with the Power Blocks is great with weight distribution as each adjuatment is always even.<br />*Power Blocks have a weight adjustments of 2 pounds increments or more.<br />*Power Blocks get smaller the less weight you use so they don't seem bulky when lifting them or get in the way with working out.<br />*They look pretty sturdy and seem to hold 90 pounds without any issues when lifting them.<br />*The housing to grab the weigh handle is a nice feature as it doesnt interfere with lifting weights and it makes it easier to control your wrist when attempting to lift much heavier sets.<br /><br />CON's<br />*As more weights are added they become bulkier which can at times interfere with certain exersices which could prevent you from doing them properly.<br />*The weight lock insert pin is made of plastic and although it seems to be made of high quality plastic and is also very flexible, the durability is in question and wonder when  it might break which could cause any weights to fall off and probably land on you or your feet or anyone else in that manner.<br />* The 2 blocks that are being held in place by 4 metallic locks are made of some sort of high quality plastic which may seem like not a big deal but this is my second replacement as the first power blocks came damaged and had a huge crack where the weights sit on the block. Durability can be in question here.<br />*They can be pretty expensive over 500$ upto 600$ for a 90 pound set.<br />*The elites only have a max weight adjustment of 90 pounds so if you plan on lifting heavier weights, you will need to invest in more weights that hold 100 pounds or more.<br />* Although this seem to be held in place pretty well and they seem rather durable, not all power blocks are made equality, care has to be taken when lifting them as durability when dropped and or thrown can damage them costing you a 500$ or more paper weight.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />Overall, if you consider the pros more then the cons and the fact that this product was made only in the USA with high quality material and price point, then i definitely recommend this Power Blocks because not only do they allow for weight adjustment of increments of 2 pounds but they are much easier to hold when lifting them and also make you push through your work out much harder. They come in sets between 50 pound sets and additional add-ons upto 90 pounds if you wish to get hard core with this. Since using this power blocks i have had no complaints so far and have allowed me to push through my work out with ease. In my opinion i have had this since February of 2019  and purchased the 90 pound set and i can say i trust this product with my work out and would recommend this product to anyone looking to improve muscle mass without the heavy cost of purchasing every weight possible to achieve muscle gain and the pain of having over 1000 pounds in weights just to achieve what the power block can do.",[],B00G7RHGNY,B00VEAH5SA,AFRC2M2EQSRREQE3LURRE2DLLP7A,1557110862745,5,True

3.0,Great price for the size & keeps stuff hot!,"UPDATE 10/16/2020:  After just less than a year of using this, the lid has begun to leak (like some other reviews - it looks to be a design flaw because there is no rubber gasket and have steadily been increasing tightness/pressure), so I have docked it 2 stars.  Now I'll be on a search again to find a insulated mug, since the price has about doubled... I would have just got another for the original price, but not worth it for less than a year of use.<br /><br />I've owned this for over a month now.  I purchased this to replace a 16oz travel mug that I've been using for the past 6 years that I lost somewhere &lt;I loved that mug!>.  Since I was used to a 16oz mug, one of the first things I noticed is that I'm able to enjoy my beverages a bit longer before needing a refill since it's 20oz.  Also, a nice thing is that the lid will screw on so the spout faces either left or right of the handle - so it is great if you want to hold in either hand. Also, I'm a fan of the look/design.  To note, the snap-seal is a bit tough to get open/closed, but I'd rather it a bit tight and keep the seal than loose and accidentally spilling.  I believe this mug is really a nice size and quality for the price (it was just over $7 when purchased).<br /><br />As far as insulation, this keeps my coffee hot for quite a while, as long I'd expect it to - especially when it's full.  Also, if you first put hot/boiling water in it for a couple mins and then dump out and put in your hot beverage of choice, it will keep hot even longer &lt;&lt;but beware if you take a sip right away because it'll scald your mouth>>.  The seals have been just fine for me, but then again I NEVER put any parts of my travel mugs in the dishwasher.  I usually just rinse with some hot water and when just wash by hand when needed - about once a week.  I noticed that people have complained about the seal become stretched out, so I have also been careful to not over-tighten the lid.  Just getting it tight by the tips of my fingers seems to be plenty, and good seal.<br /><br />The only thing that I don't really like is the top/lip where it pours out from the spout.  It has a slight curve/angle to it, so that when you tip the mug to get a sip - a bunch immediately rushes into your mouth. So this makes it very hard to control how much you get when trying to sip.  This is a very annoying feature for me, because I do like to take tiny sips right away, but I can't really sip because it pours out quickly into my mouth.  If the top/lip just had a straight edge, I would have given this a 5 star rating.<br /><br />One other thing is just a slight annoyance as well, is that the bottom of the mug is metallic.  Therefore, it slides very easily and makes a ding noise whenever you set it down.  So, I just wish it had a rubberized bottom like my last mug &lt;&lt;I may even try making a rubber bottom for it>>.",[],B00T7MLVUA,B0C4VWCZRV,AFHPZCDUHPADNQ3J5IFLT75QHTIA,1578690196207,0,True

I tried to ride my bike and 2x I had to go back home to put air in the tire.  1st time, air was in went back on the road and immediately, 2 blocks away, they went flat.  I thought that I did something wrong so I went back and put air in again. This time I didn't even get 50nft away from my door.  They immediatybwent flat. So WTH?

We spent 3 hours, freezing, pulling every pepper we could find.  We filled a laundry basket!  Now what?  How are we going to salvage these peppers, before they spoil or rot!  We dehydrated the entire load.  Some of the peppers were half green half orange, didnt matter, they were still hot.  We set our dehydrator at 135 degrees and 24 hours later, they were  like a fortune cookie.  Next we put hem in a blender, and blended them to a fine pepper and placed them in Mason jars.

4.0,Subaru owners be warned,"Ok - This is my initial review of the Napier SUV tent, I will do an update in August when I return from my trip. My daughter and I are planning a two week girls' trip in a giant loop from Wyoming to Tennessee and back, so we should see various weather with this tent. We took it up to the mountains here in Wyoming and spent the night for a test run. The set up is super simple and quick. Takes us about 5 minutes with both of us and only slightly longer if I do it myself. Teardown is even faster. We didn't use the stakes as there was almost no wind, but they are pretty wimpy so I'll pack sturdier ones for our actual trip. In my 2018 Subaru Outback, it may not look like much but it extends the back area by about 8 inches at the base, allowing for more foot room when you're stretched out sleeping (we cut our memory foam mattress to allow for that extra room and curl the back edge up inside when driving). It also allows for way more headroom in the very back hatch area, so you can actually sit up. The screen area in the back is large and easy to get in/out of and allows for good ventilation and visibility. No mosquitoes got in, and there were plenty at the campsite. In addition to the Napier tent, I also purchased stretchy, slip-on bug screens for my rear windows which worked great for increased ventilation, as well as custom fitted reflective window covers for the front side windows to increase privacy and keep out heat. Over all, I was very happy with the set up. *Now, here's the warning*...newer model Subarus with electronic lift gates - unless you do your own little hack, leaving the lift gate up for any length of time will continuously draw power and kill your battery. This has nothing to do with your dome lights (obviously you need to have them turned off or they will also draw power and kill the battery), it's a Subaru oversight that there is no easy option to ""turn off""  power to the lift gate. The hack to get around this is simple and there are Youtube videos to show you how to avoid the problem. Don't let the battery/liftgate issue deter you from buying this tent, just be aware of it from the start. Thankfully, we learned our lesson the hard way by camping in the driveway for a night before ever heading up to our completely deserted campground. For the time being, I am giving the tent 4 out of 5 stars for design and ease of use. I'll update it after dealing with wind, rain, and extreme heat/humidity.<br /><br />Update: We took this on a car-camping expedition of multiple states during July of 2020. The tent was a saving grace that allowed for decent breezes/air exchange in very humid/hot areas of the country. It also allowed us to really stretch out in our Subaru Outback, both for leg room and for sitting up in the very back while hanging out in the evenings and early mornings. Unfortunately, or really fortunately, we never had the opportunity to test it out in rain. I don't know how the tent holds up nor how my own vehicle handles it with the tent on (based on the slope of the back of the Subaru Outback and the way the channels for the lift gate are configured, I'd guess...not well, but I don't really know at this point).<br /><br />Regardless of my lack of total experiences with this tent and my own vehicle, I personally recommend this tent and feel that it was a very worthwhile investment. I've only used it a dozen times but I already feel like worth what I paid.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813KH0BkUCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813KH0BkUCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813KH0BkUCL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bDUDbc+-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bDUDbc+-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bDUDbc+-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pP7keTFuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pP7keTFuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pP7keTFuL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01MUEGMLR,B01MUEGMLR,AGM5C472KRX2QRGOISFSFMD6KMUQ,1594598990276,4,False

2.0,Hours spent laying it down,"This mat took hours to lay down.  Theoretically, this should be easy to put together since it's like a puzzle.  But the mats are super thick (which I guess is good in the end), and they don't connect with each other without alot effort and force.  They take several minutes to put just one together and you have to use a lot of force to mesh them together.<br /><br />There's no instructions on how to correctly and easily connect them together so if you don't do it right, you could easily spend hours upon hours trying to put them together.  If you do not align the pieces together precisely one after the other, then later on, the rest won't go together.<br /><br />The company seriously needs to reconsider the actual product  Or at least give some warning on how difficult and time consuming it takes to put it together.<br /><br />Overall disappointed and very frustrated.",[],B001KP018K,B018MWVRGS,AFRGHYFQZZUNSK7FUSRBYXUMPAGQ,1351146039000,0,False

5.0,"Solid upgrade from the previous version, mainstay in my pack now!","I have been an owner of this spot lamp's predecessor for several years.  You could call this headlamp the same thing, but there are several innovations that make this leaps and bounds above any other model I've used!<br /><br />This headlamp is light, and very bright! I chose one in the covert green as it matches my hunting gear well.  The main selling point on this model, and which caused me to upgrade, was the red LED's.  My last hunting trip was a night hunt, and a friend of mine had a red LED headlamp as well (though a different brand).  When he was able to switch on the red light, it did not destroy my night vision which had been adjusting over 30 minutes.  The downside to his light was that it would cycle through regular to red, defeating the purpose of the red LEDS, ruining my night vision, and scaring potential game.  This model can permanently switch to red without having to cycle through white.  Holding down the button for 3 seconds will make the switch so that each time you press the button it will turn it from off to on, all the while remaining in red mode.  To switch it back to normal, hold for another 3 seconds... brilliant.<br /><br />While in the normal LED mode, it has two settings.  The central brightest LED, and the secondary dimmer LED's.  Both can be dimmed intuitively with a little practice.  While in either mode, hold the power button and it will dim slowly like moving dimmer switch.  Just release when it reaches the desired level.  This works the opposite way for brightening too.<br /><br />The strobe function can be achieved by using similar switch combinations.  The lockout feature is a huge plus.  Several times my old model had switched on in my cargo pocket, or in my pack.  Holding the switch for 6 seconds will lock the unit out unless you hold it for another 6 seconds (it will let you know by flashing blue on the indicator light).  I haven't tested the low battery indicator, but no doubt it works just as great.<br /><br />This is by no means a detraction against the rating of this model, but the functions have a bit of a learning curve... read the quick start guide!  I was a bit overwhelmed by something that you would think would be very simple, but this thing has an impressive amount of functionality achieved through ONE switch!  Once you learn how to use it, it's very intuitive.<br /><br />As a testament to its reliability, I've owned the previous model for around 4 years.  It's been through dozens of camping trips, a lot work around the house, car work, and misc fun!  It's not a main flashlight replacement, but meant to be a great light for tasks you'll need in most situations (all the while keeping your hands free).  This is the best and smartest on the market, and for the price... don't hesitate and buy it.",[],B004AJI97I,B004AJI97I,AE4ARSPBXWNKBJMYSIUTGHMJYNPQ,1299534258000,6,True

5.0,Great tramp!,"[[VIDEOID:e87be58c39d3ad992f55b840da57de86]] Colorado was hit with a massive 23 inch snowstorm with snow drifts up to 30 inches+. Let's just say my old trampoline didn't fair too well under the massive amount of heavy snow so had to buy a new one. After looking at a few I decided to go with this Bpulse one. One of the main reasons is not only the 16ft diameter in size large area but the fact it has a basketball hoop. Plus it comes with a ladder, my old one I had to buy one separately.<br />The instructions were surprisingly easy to follow and although it did take a decent amount of time it was fairly easy to install. It comes with a ton of springs and once all set up the mat is tight. It comes with foam noodles to go around the poles which helps prevent them from getting hot and burning your hand as well as protection in case you jump into them. The net is nice because it keeps bugs out but also lets air freely flow through. Most importantly it helps keep my kid and friends safe from falling off. Last thing I need to worry about is a broken bone!<br />Overall, it seems like a very well made quality trampoline that should hopefully hold up better than my last one.

3.0,. . . . . ALMOST GOOD; TEARING UP !,"Just recently bought this (brown/tan) and a wolfwise pop up to compare; the Leader Accessories is bigger/wider by far and more amicable in my viewpoint vs. the wolfwise.  The narrowing in the top is where wolfwise loses and gets really claustrophobic vs. the Leader Accessories. I bought the Leader Accessories for ability to changeover from clothes to swimming attire as needed and also to self shower w/ a handheld battery shower (w/ 5 gal buckets).  IN that regard; it works perfect.  NICE TO HAVE: I do wish the top/side of the Leader Accessories was netted vs. just zipping open; but overall just to have some venting method is a huge plus, period.  The interior  pockets are adequate and no complaints there; due to the size of the popup; this definitely is very easy to 'blow' around; so definitely needs to be staked down or tied down to something.<br />QUALITY: during our first outing this past weekend with it; we were packing up to leave our campsite and noticed before we 'rolled' it up that it was already 'tearing' through the fabric/stitching area; about 2-3 inches . We were really hoping to be able to get at least 1 year if not more of usage before any wear/tear would show up on it; but barely 48 hours and here we are . . . (I'm thinking of using duct tape to stabilize/protect that area and ride it out. . .<br />Overall; pretty good; not sure if the cost justifies the product quality.",[],B073GTQFMX,B07KFB8GF1,AGJ4WKYTQL5GTQYEFXGIIDD2Q46Q,1563820149696,15,True

With all sides being mesh material, this tent was great in providing excellent air flow even with the side panels closed.<br /><br />I would have given this 5 stars but the instructions are somewhat challenging.  Once you understand the concept behind them it goes together fairly easy.  We did encounter one problem as we were not given the correct pieces for one of the support legs.

The removable line cutters is a great addition as I like my line cutters really sharp.

I'm personally not a fan of straws, they're a pain to clean and well ladies, they're the new cigarette smoking lines around your mouth in the future- so not for me. I wanted something easy open, leak proof and free flowing for my new 40oz Hydro. This was it. It has a handle just like the original cap which is a bonus. The opening is big but not super big. The cap not only covers but twists closed so no spilling. The gaskets on both the cap and the lid appear sturdy and I've had no leakage from either.

I rinsed the flasks, per instructions, and set the caps on a paper towel. The next morning my cat had discovered them and had fun playing with the bottle caps. Luckily, we finally found the one that had been written off as gone forever. They'd be hard to replace, unless you can order them separately, so pay attention to where you put the caps.

5.0,A well-built track/floor pump that looks like it'll last like my last one (RIP Zefal Husky),"I had to replace my ancient Zefal heavy-duty track pump which I bought in the '80s. (the top cap, the only plastic bit on it, broke when I dropped it one too many times and crazy-glue wouldn't hold)  I'm mostly a road biker so I needed a high-pressure pump with a standard Presta head.  I wanted a steel barrel for durability, a cast base for stability, a pressure release, and either a top-mounted gauge or a BIG one like with this pump.  And it had to be rebuildable.  My choices seemed only to be SILCA or this Lezyne model. To be honest, I have lusted after SILCA pumps for years, but when it came down to it I just couldn't spend $125 on a pump when this model checks all the boxes at $60.<br />Some have complained that the gauge isn't accurate, for me, it's accurate enough (within a few PSI) because I usually check tire pressure with a separate, accurate gauge B4 I ride.<br />Bonus: it takes less than 20 strokes to fill 700Cx25 tire to 105 PSI.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kxYbWb5eL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kxYbWb5eL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kxYbWb5eL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07CR59YNN,B07ZQXL5DM,AFKKOBEF2BXTPHZC4AKY7GUF6MFQ,1604444982795,3,True

5.0,Exactly as advertised.,"I won't say 5 stars means it's the best EV scooter out there, but it is exactly what we wanted for our 12 year old son. We bought him a Razor EV scooter rated for 12mph and that thing barely could move him (130lbs) up a 5 degree slope.<br />So we returned the Razor and purchased the Hiboy S2. It was on sale but slightly higher than the price advertised today. We chose the S2 because it came with solid non-inflatable tires, 19mph, 17 mile range.<br />It has enough power and torque to drive up a 20 degree inclined street with a bit of degradation at the top of the hill. Coming down the same hill we cn mx out at 23 mph. On flat surfaces it does reach 19 mph.<br />Battery life is quite good. Don't know exact miles per charge but it does hold the charge over 40 minutes of riding. At constant 19 mph, it should take you about 53 minutes to reach 17 miles max range.<br />It recharges without any issue so far. Hope to keep the battery life healthy by charging it once month during the winter season.<br />There are two speeds built in the app where you can set max speed to 13 mph or 19 mph. For the first week my snows riding around set to 13 mph. Once he got used to the scooter he rode it at full 19 mph. It also has electric braking which I think helps to recharge the battery - like in F1 cars. He has to kick start the scooter for it to start moving. The throttle won't engage unless the scooter starts moving. This feature prevents it from starting suddenly from a full stop.<br />Build quality is excellent. When compared to the Gotrax scooters, the main steering tube is smaller in diameter than the Gotrax, and the deck is much thicker then Gotrax. Gotrax houses the batteries in the steering tube while the Hiboy is under the deck. The Gotrax looks more streamed lined but both equally built well.<br />So far the solid tires have been holding up but showing some wear. We may have to get new tires sometime mid season next year.<br />We bough this Hiboy because my 12 year old is 130lbs and 5'2"". Any other kids EV scooter would not be ideal for him. Note that the steering tube is taller on the adult S2 than kids size. I would not recommend for kids under 5 ft tall.

I did reel in ONE turtle who wouldn't let go though!<br />I've gotten so good as to tell from afar whether a turtle took it under or gamefish.  The fish would break water explosively whereas the turtles drag it under subtlely.  Each time, the lure takes in water as its collapsed by the bite and you just squeeze the water back out to allow it to float again.<br />The Koppers frog is the best lure in my box for getting in and around cover though.<br />The area of the body near the hook-point will be the first place to go as I see some wear there from the point rubbing it.  After 3 outings, the frog is starting to take in more water so my longer casts end up with the frog underwater at the end of the reel-in.  No obvious tears or holes so I've epoxied the known areas where water could easily enter and will try it out on the next outing to see how it goes.<br /><br />Overall a great lure to use around heavy cover where you just wouldn't wanna lose other lures in your box but I'd rate it ""advanced"" to use because I've yet to reel one in on it.",[],B008ODMZ1M,B008ODMZ1M,AFKKAINREDY6VUA3X3KWKCYKGK6Q,1371145456000,0,False

I ended up getting it for about $35.  Things were going all right step wise (pulse worked about 4 times, then stopped) until about 7 months after I started using it, it just stopped working. Nothing. Tried resetting, plugging it in, letting it charge for a while- this bugger's just done.<br /><br />I'd just avoid these all together... I really liked it at first, and made excuses for the bad relationship I had with it making promises it could never keep. The features that they try to sell don't work and they're hard to hang onto.

3.0,It fit but not enough cushion for me.,"I found the cushion to actually fit the awkward size and shape of my seat. But the cushion just was not right for me.<br /><br /> I actually think it made the seat more uncomfortable. I think maybe it made me sit on the seat awkwardly, otherwise I can’t really explain how a gel cushion could be more sore. It was like a specific spot that became less comfortable than before. Overall I just think it didn’t provide enough cushion for it to make a difference.<br /><br />I forgot to take a picture of the cushion on the seat. But I do have a picture of what my seat shape is for anyone looking for a a cushion that fits a similar seat style. I bought this for an upright exercise bike that has a wide but not long heart shaped saddle. Roughly, I want to say my seat is 11 to maybe 12” wide by 8 1/2 to maybe 9” long. Not sure on the exact dimensions. The manufacturer said 12” on the product page for the bike, but I kept measuring something in between.<br /><br />Also, I am on the heavier side so maybe this gel cushion will work for someone who’s a little bit lighter. Or someone with a different seat style. It just didn’t work for me personally.<br /><br />Pros:<br />It one of the few cushions available that could fit the seat size I have. Honestly can’t find anything else that is close to a match without being too large.<br /><br />Quality seemed alright. Seams held when stretched.<br /><br />Had straps to secure the front from sliding around.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I just didn’t find it provided enough comfort for me<br /><br />Possibly not thick enough<br /><br />Side note:<br />It did fit my seat but it takes a lot of effort to fit it onto a seat that wide. But it does stretch and it did not tear or leak.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1AHTc2HicS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1AHTc2HicS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1AHTc2HicS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1fDuKcK31S._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1fDuKcK31S._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1fDuKcK31S._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0824VLNK2,B08MF3KJ36,AFSTK7RPEJNR5GHPYSLIAS7CNURQ,1616361055999,21,True

5.0,Terrific for soccer!!  Breathable and offer more foot protection.,"So far so good!  I bought these for soccer, as the ones the team provided were very thin and cheap. These have a bit more padding underfoot and up the heel to just under the ankle. They also provide more cushion to the entire toe area, including above the toes, which is what I wanted for soccer, since I am a defender, I want more protection for my toes from, tackles, getting stomped on, and for clearing the ball out of the area.  These also provide a bit of compression for the calf muscles, although not quite as much as a true compression sock.  I use these with size 9 Adidas ACE 15.1 FG/AG, and I also wrap my ankles, and these have not yet stretched out from that either.  My Adidas F50 shin guards fit in these with no problem, too, although I use a compression sleeve to hold them in place, and to provide further compression. I went ahead and bought a pair of black ones for my other team, since I really enjoyed using these ones! Highly recommend!!  If they don't last too long I'll come back and edit the review, but after 2 games in these, and 2 games in the black ones, so far so good!!  I play indoors and outdoors and I am about 5'10&#34; and 160 lbs, and these fit my size 9 easily, although they have room to stretch around my ankle wrap, and could stretch just a little more, if necessary.",[],B01ARQXTUY,B01ARQXTUY,AGNEWAPQCWNDW52TRLQU34AKA4IA,1473187349000,1,True

It is 8 years old and still working like a charm. We love it still and enjoy using it everyday.

1.0,Terrible flip-top design.,"The CamelBak website claims that the patented flip-top bite valve lets you sip without tipping or spilling. Unfortunately, this particular bottle did both.<br /><br />This flip-top design is different from the one that CamelBak had on the Better Bottle (as seen here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019D9D3W/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).<br /><br />I had three problems with this bottle:<br /><br />1. Unlike the Better Bottle's design, this bite valve is entirely made of silicone. For a few days, retracting the valve into the drinking position was a two-handed operation, which was annoying.<br /><br />2. After the flip-top eventually loosened up, it became loose to the point where it would not close when I pushed the flip-top forward to secure it. So, whenever I placed the bottle in my backpack or if the bottle happened to accidentally lay on its side, the flip-top could easily be moved into the drinking position, causing the bottle to leak from the base of the flip-top. The valve itself never leaked.<br /><br />3. As if the above-issues weren't enough, the bottle began leaking even while it was untouched and in its normal, upright position. The leak was coming from the base of this terrible flip-top design. The leak was much worse whenever I retrieved the bottle from the refrigerator and set it on a flat surface.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I couldn't find a replacement cap that had the original Better Bottle flip-top design. Even the CamelBak web site doesn't have it available. I may have had a defective valve, but even so, the issues I experienced were a major pain in the okole (that's your derriere, in Hawaiian).<br /><br />Since I once owned a Better Bottle and never had an issue with its flip-top design, I purchased another one. This Eddy Bottle flip-top design was a bad idea. I would not recommend it.<br /><br />Words of advice:<br />If you decide to purchase any CamelBak bottle, make sure you look at any available images and zoom in on the valve area so that you can see the differences.<br />Also, if you purchase the 1-Liter bottle (the largest that CamelBak offers), your vehicle's cup holder needs to be at least 3.5 inches in diameter to accommodate it.",[],B006ZT902Y,B007DZSG06,AF5OR77IP5FSUV7HXVFTQVVXUPMQ,1370397308000,3,True

5.0,I will never ride my bike without one again!,"I ride my bike quite a bit and the rides are always 10 miles or more at full speed with some hill climbing always mixed in. Well needless to say that often times left me with a dry and dehydrated feeling mouth with the wind constantly whipping across my face. On top of that with the high humidity here in South Georgia a 95 degree day feels like pure torture sometimes so staying hydrated is not an option it's a must if you want to last while riding. In the past I have tried juggling bottles back and forth along my ride but never again will that be the case. With this pack full I can easily ride 15-20 miles even in the middle of the summer without ever having to stop or reach for a bottle. On top of that this pack is so light even when it's full that I literally forget I am wearing it, well of course until I need a little liquid heaven and I effortlessly grab that tube and bite down getting a little splash of G2 Gatorade while continuing to bear down on that burning hot asphalt. There is also a nice little zip up pouch on this pack that will easily hold a cell phone, some keys, and probably even an energy bar. I am sure this pack would work for running, hiking, and a million other outdoor activities but for biking I can guarantee this thing is the ticket!",[],B00EPGTKCO,B00J08L7RI,AHH3OVOD32NY5CI24NCDNABPRJ2A,1462291049000,2,True

3.0,Product is fine with some durability issues and a usability issue.,"I've now had this product for  bit over 3 years with moderate camping use. Overall I'm happy with it. It works, the bug fly is useful, etc.<br /><br />There are some durability problems, though. The bug netting has loops sewn in to hold it up with guy lines, but the loops are not reinforced. I've now had to patch two of them that broke. Similarly the metal for the hooks and zippers is vulnerable to rusting.<br /><br />Usability-wise my biggest gripe is that the length of the tree straps is a poor fit to the length of the rain fly. What I mean is that the size and distance of trees that are close enough to hang the hammock but far enough away to fit the rain fly is kind of limited.",[],B01KGOVEI6,B01KGOVEI6,AG6NQPSRH5XF2ZECBI7N2J6WQ6WA,1600808612558,0,False

5.0,another solid quality liquid container by Thermos,"I bought this because being a regular gym goer, I must intake a good amount of water throughout the day. In addition, by being in the military, I am encouraged to stay hydrated at all times. This bottle is the perfect tool to enable me to accomplish that goal. Also, I was fed up with buying and throwing away so many relatively expensive 1 liter ""sport"" designed bottled water bottles. I wanted to save money and my trashcan buy purchasing the cumbersome, albeit less expensive 1.5 liter bottles (hey I'm trying, environmentalists). I would've gone with the 5 gallon jug, but it is just too impractical to pour and it doesn't fit inside my fridge (or my trashcan).<br /><br />Design: This is a tall and slender bottle made of BPA-free plastic, with a fairly solid loop for attaching it to things (and vice versa), which fits in with many other styles on the market. For grip, it has a wide textured surface running down one side, which also curves slightly inward, allowing a more comfortable hold for smaller hands. On the reverse, it has a dual measurement scale in liters and fluid ounces. The liters scale goes from 0.1L by every 100 milliliters up to 0.6L, while the fluid ounces is scaled from 4oz by every 4 ounces to 20oz, although it can hold 24 ounces. The look is very interesting and unique, as far as plastic water bottles go.<br /><br />Performance: Well, I have very large hands and it is indeed comfortable to grip. I assume that the textured side is where the fingers wrap around to, but in any case, you can have it on either side, depending on how you twist the cap onto the bottle. Now onto the cap, which is this bottle's bread and butter. It twists off with ease, opening the way to the wide mouthed opening of the base, which allows for easy pouring into and for dropping in large solid objects, like ice. It has a silicon seal inside, so it stays put with no leaks when you twist it back on. The mechanism for drinking is by way of a large thumb button on the front and a flip-top lid. There is a thin metal latch that flips up nicely over and around the button so you don't have an accidental discharge of all your liquid inside your bag or on the floor. The bottle is touted as no leak because the flip-top lid has a silicon pad underneath which creates a seal on the ""spout"" when closed. In fact, the entire mouthpiece is covered, protecting it from the environment. Another useful gimmick added to the lid is a rotating dial on top which is there to help keep track of how many bottles you drink.<br /><br />Usability: First off, I've used many different hydration containers with all sorts of mouth pieces and I must say, I don't like putting my mouth on stuff when I drink out of it. The bite valve used on CamelBak's bottles and hydration pouches is pretty novel, but I not only have to put my mouth on it (leaving residue), but also bite into it, thereby grinding everything it is exposed to further into the valve and sucking up whatever is left. The squeeze bottles where the seal breaks when enough pressure is applied is okay, but they just aren't solid enough for me. Thermos finally has it right. The flip-top lid works exactly as it should. You press the button and it quickly snaps open and stays there, due to a small silicon band wrapped in a way that applies constant tension to the lid, but is easy to snap close with one finger. The mouthpiece is perfect for me because it is large (but not too large) enough for me to basically pour a steady stream of water into my mouth for quick hydration. The true test is when you aren't thinking about it like, say, when at the gym doing high intensity workouts. The mechanism was so smooth (open and close) that it did not interrupt or deter me one bit. As for the rotating dial, it takes more than you think to turn this thing. Being smooth plastic, you really must put some pressure on it to rotate it, even with the grooves. It is still functional to me.<br /><br />Overall, for my purposes, this is an excellent and unique design for a hydration bottle. Because there aren't many porous internal surfaces, you can put liquids other than water in there. But, not for long and you must rinse it out immediately afterwards, so I wouldn't recommend it. Just an FYI, if you do not care about the rotating dial, Thermos also makes a similar Under Armour version which has a slightly shorter lid and smaller thumb button. The bottle also seems to be made of slightly thicker plastic, so it maybe could survive harder crashes. I can't really say for sure. It is also slightly cheaper at $15.99 right now on Amazon, but only $12.99 in the PX for those in the military.",[],B00DPLUF24,B00FOFZWAY,AFJV66IBMVFWSSSZILEDHWYJKBQQ,1391974177000,21,True

There are three things about the way this bag is designed that I didn't like. First, there is a waist strap like on hiking backpacks that has zip storage compartments on either side.  These are unnecessary and need to be fiddled with so they aren't pinned behind your back every time you put it on, which will be a lot if you're like me and will be taking the bag off for every shot. Second, the bag does not stand upright on the ground but instead leans towards the water bottle side which makes your discs harder to access.  Third, the way the discs are stored (flat vs most other bags where they slot in) means your discs are stored in 7 different areas of the bag and you'll need to look around to find the disc you want.  This last point I should have been able to figure out just from looking at it, but like I said this was my first shot at a backpack for my discs.

It takes multiple attempts to calibrate to get even a remotely accurate reading. Your weight will vary up to 20 pounds and your body fat up to 10% every time you get on it. And heaven forbid if you should move it after calibration because that means it is no longer calibrated.<br />My UA Band now refuses to connect to my phone at all and turns itself on and off constantly until it runs out of power. Also, the LCD display begins to burn out after about a month to the point you can't tell if it's a 4, 5, or the run icon.<br />And don't even try to get HTC to provide warranty service. Their little clause that if it's more than 15 months after manufacture makes the warranty conditions VERY limited. HTC pretty much washes their hands of their own products.

5.0,Excellent for backpacking /river trips,Adirondacks/ Raquette River trip. The bumping and banging of backpacking/canoe river trips are tough on fishing gear. Especially fly rods. This set is an excellent combination of both spinning rod and fly rod in a lightweight protective case.  The 7 foot rod could have been 1 segment longer but the action was sensitive enough for dry flys. The brown trout were hitting the flys above the falls and the smallmouth bass were hitting the lures below the falls - who could ask for anything more! The spinning reel had plenty of room with 10lb test. I'd recommend this kit for anyone traveling or looking for a lightweight combination when backpacking. I'd also like to suggest the package come with two tips so if one breaks while traveling/ camping you don't lose use of the rod. The foam packing and the handy case make attachment to a backpack easy; this kit also fits well in the trunk of my car.

I contacted the customer service of this company and followed their recommendations. Still, no success.<br />They were kind enough to send a second camera but I still had the same issues! I figured that there was something I was missing and had my buddy at work take a look at it. He figured out that there was nothing wrong with either of the cameras, but that I needed to restart my phone with the adapter (I bought separately) with SD card inserted.<br />So if you're camera is blinking and ready for taking pictures but you can't see any images when trying to view on your Samsung phone, please restart your phone.

From &#34;The Grind&#34; to &#34;Lotus&#34;, every track is great. The arrangements are fabulous, the song selection, is outstanding. I've listened to this album (on vinyl at first) since 1977, when I first heard it at a friends house. Bought my own copy shortly thereafter. I have listened to Teaser since then, it is a true timeless masterpiece. Tommy's guitar work is absolutely great, but he wasn't so vain that the guitar work is long, boring solos. No he made sure this album had great MUSIC, not just a vehicle to show off his playing. I've loved this album almost 40 years, and still love it. I recommend every track, but if I was forced to name what I consider &#34;must hear&#34; tracks, I'd say &#34;Dreamer&#34;, &#34; Savannah Woman&#34;, &#34;People, People&#34;, &#34;Wild Dogs&#34;, and &#34; Lotus&#34;, every track is great though.

5.0,Very happy with purchase,"I waited for a while to write a review on this, to see how the treadmill would hold up to 1/2 marathon training. I am unable to run outside, because of visual impairments, so my training is solely done on this treadmill. I have been very pleased with it so far, and I've run about 200 miles on it. The inclines are good, and I especially enjoy the interval training mode. As far as the complaints about the fan from previous reviews, I don't find it a problem. It may not blow directly in your face, but I think it was designed to just circulate the air around a bit to cool you off. I rather like it. There are 3 settings to the fan, and I increase it as my workout continues. As far as the speaker on the board, well, that's just a cheap speaker, nothing more, nothing less. I wasn't expecting much in that department, so I wasn't disappointed. I plug my I-pod into the treadmill, anyway, and use earbuds. That works perfectly, with no distortion. The digital read-outs on the panel are easy to see (even with my visual impairment), and as far as treadmills go, the distance/calories calibration is okay. I couldn't afford a more expensive treadmill, and considering the price & quality of this, I think it's an excellent buy.",[],B005AC1H6Y,B005AC1H6Y,AGTWUF6ITTRLJTVB2Q3HY4FIDTOQ,1365034021000,2,True

Even though he followed all the instructions, and filtered the water through a clean coffee filter first, the product did not purify the water, which we took from a nearby lake.  The bacteria levels were almost as high as in the control. A big disappointment.  Also, it did not appear that the light area was sealed properly in the factory, as it had condensation inside the light area after it was removed from the water and cleaned.

5.0,Fun board and great customer service,"Received all items as described (the board, roller, inflatable balance pad, and DVD). The art on the board is just as vibrant as the pictures. Though now that I've had it for a while kinda wish I had bought one of the other motifs as it was pointed out to me that the wave is kinda phallic looking and now thats all I see lol. Item was packaged very well, however the DVD that came with it had a scratch. I contacted the seller and they quickly responded to my email to let me know they would immediately send a replacement. Few days later I received not one, but 2 instructional discs. Makes me think either the 2nd disc was sent accidentally or they just wanted to ensure I wouldn't have any issues. Either way happy with the service. I have only had the board for a few weeks now but I've been enjoying using it when watching tv, or when I'm in a conference call (I work from home).

I also have my concealed carry permit and like to bring my firearm along with us on our hikes.  This pack is the PERFECT solution to that.  I bring my SIG P226 with us and use the Red Rock Universal Holster to secure it.  I not only have enough room for my keys, cell phone, can of chew, snacks, small zip lock bag of dog food, collapsible water bowl and extra mags, but there is still organized room for things like a flashlight, extra shirt or windbreaker, LOTS... plus with the molle attachments you could literally customize this to your liking.<br />Now.. Construction... its top notch!  the zippers are hardcore! the stitching is fantastic! Fabric is thick and hardy.  I wear this cross body style and don't even know its there.  When I attach the waist strap I can easily run with my dog and it stays in place, including my firearm.  If they had these in pink my wife would have one right now.  LOL<br />Bottom line, I couldn't be more happy with this sling pack and highly recommend this to anyone. Even to just load up and keep in your vehicle incase you have have to head out on foot.  The extra compartments are perfect so you can keep certain things separated.  4 thumbs up!",[],B0098FRP8I,B0098FRP8I,AGW3ENWAKW4T7TCIWWVODFV7O5XA,1449937378000,2,True

The floorspace is just enough for me (5,7&#34;) to lie down without touching the sides, and My standard thermarest air mattress fits as well. Plenty of room to sit up and change clothes. The huge screen doors and pop up vents in the fly provide excellent ventilation.

The dark polymer coating also flakes off when the wire is stressed, which is noticeable when using a third hand tool.

4.0,It works for what it does.,"I installed this on my Cannondale Quick hybrid. Installation was straightforward and the rack is sturdy and fits securely.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />--The rack is easy to install on a standard modern bike frame, and could be done even by someone who doesn't have a great deal of experience at bicycle maintenance. Some tools (an Allen wrench certainly, vise grips and/or end wrench helpful) will be required.<br /><br />--The rack is very sturdy. Once securely attached, I can bang on it and it will hardly budge. I can easily lift the bicycle up by the rack without it feeling strained or having it shifting or wobbling.<br /><br />--The rack easily accommodates my standard panniers, and would work for most panniers, baskets, etc., that don't use some type of proprietary rail or clip system. It does not have a lot of protrusions or unusual shapes that would get in the way of attaching standard cargo carriers.<br /><br />--The rack, for as sturdy as it is, is quite light and doesn't even really add noticeably to the weight of the bike. Still, if you wanted it off to save the weight at some point, deinstallation and reinstallation would be very straightforward.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />--(Deduct 1 star) The bolts that come with the rack feel soft and won't take the nut more than a few turns up (tried with several, so was not just a single cross thread). They work for temporary use, but will need to be replaced with better bolts and nuts from an actual hardware store. Decent nuts and bolts don't cost much; they should've gone to the trouble here.<br /><br />--The included long bolts could be too long in some cases, protruding into and interfering with the space for the chain or derailleur. That wasn't an issue in my case but is something to be cautious of.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good rack that will fit a standard frame with a minimum of fuss or engineering effort, and comes at a very reasonable cost. Bolts and nuts are cheap, but do plan on buying them if you get this.<br /><br />There are several adapters included for more unusual installations. As I didn't need any of them, I can't speak to their quality or usefulness.",[],B000RYAKRM,B000SPMU9Q,AEERYIV6QL5F22FWA562RVBY3F4Q,1403991247000,42,True

A quick release wheel skewer does the same with the wheels.<br /><br />Nothing about this ""quick release"" performs a quick release function. The Shotgun seat does not come off easily at all. Watch the installation video on YouTube...you will have to do the reverse of that and take the entire thing apart every time you remove this from your bike. You MAY not have to remove the seat and loosen the top bolt depending on how tight you made that when you put it on. Less tight is obviously less secure.  In fact, the only thing the quick release skewer actually does on this seat is give you a little extra leverage in order to help secure the seat a bit more. A useful feature, but not a quick release in any way. A wing nut or thumb screw or something would have sufficed but wouldn't allow you to tighten as much. In order to remove this seat from the bike, you still have to completely unscrew both the ""quick release"" skewer and the foot pegs, at a minimum, and possibly also take off the seat and unscrew the top bolt, which means you have to take it completely apart to remove it.<br /><br />The foot pegs are also a bit of a pain to get on/off...they don't just unscrew from each other...you have to first unscrew one, then loosen 2 little nuts under the frame in between the foot pegs to just the right spot so you can slide the foot peg bolt completely out.<br /><br />I bought this primarily because it said it was quick release and I have to install / remove the seat on a regular basis.",[],B07PSMWB5S,B07PSMWB5S,AEFDUE4W4Y7RFMQW5X2PWC5R2H3Q,1574289072902,32,True

3.0,"Performs great, looks awesome, damages too easily.","These look amazing on the field, they offer excellent clarity and they even work very well on overcast days.<br />They work great in the open field as well as in the woods. I have 2 lenses; a clear lens and this lens.<br />I never use the clear lens. I never need to even on heavily overcast days.<br /><br />The &#34;HDR&#34; on these lenses I think is just an artificial polarization of the coating on the lens. If you've ever worn polarized sunglasses you will get a good idea of what to expect with these lenses; they are very similar.<br /><br />The problem I have with them is they scratch far too easily. I got hit square in the lens this last weekend and the paintball left an exact circle of scratches exactly where it hit. A nice big round group of scratches from a paintball. Mask lenses are designed and produced to withstand direct paintball hits yet the coating or whatever on these lenses takes cosmetic damage from paintballs.<br /><br />In conclusion I love the look of these lenses and they perform very well on the field. However at a $50 price point I would expect higher durability. As lens hits are quite common in paintball I can't imagine these lasting more than one season.<br /><br />Edit - 4/25/16: I am updating my review a bit because I received another of these lens as a gift.<br />This past weekend was the first game I used them. The results I experienced were identical to my initial pair.<br /><br />They work great as far as eye protection, anti-fog and style goes but they are just NOT DURABLE.<br />I took several direct hits to the lens this weekend and each hit left a very distinct and noticeable circle of scratches on the lens coating.<br />For some additional background I play at a very well known and regulated field with very strict chrono rules. So it's not like the hits that caused the damage were some outrageous FPS shots. The damage is being done under normal/standard conditions.<br /><br />In conclusion - I'd drop my review to a 2.5 if I could. I will keep using these lens if people keep buying them for me... but I would definitely not purchase them on my own. I probably would have bought an entirely different mask this season if I had not gotten the second lens as a gift.",[],B00PI8BI9G,B00PI8BI9G,AEJKOX5W7T5BYHLMPAIID6LE6IAQ,1430246182000,4,False

With this telescope rod, I can retract it down to a size that makes it so easy to carry and load into the kayak as well as changing lures, weights and things of that nature.  Once I’m out on the water, I can extend the rod to size and start fishing stress free. This rod is a steal for the price. Extremely solid rod especially for those who kayak fish.

4.0,Great portable charger for travelers!,"These are great tools to have when you go camping or hiking to keep your cell phone, tablet, GPS, iPod or other electronic devices charged. It's an extra battery when you need it.<br /><br />In the very well-constructed box, you get the solar panel, a flex regulator, a flashlight/battery pack and a forty-inch speed cable to charge the flashlight/battery pack. All of this comes in a nice built-in case, with Velcro closures and mesh pockets, that folds up into a rectangle about 12 x 6 x 1 inches. It's lightweight and portable, fitting easily into a backpack, carry-on or day-pack. The solar panel, when fully opened, is about 12 3/4 inches square. It has four Velcro flaps with loops, so you can hang the solar panel up or attach it to your back pack. The mesh pockets have elastic at the top to secure the other items or any small devices you want to take on your trip.<br /><br />The solar panel will charge the flash light/battery pack, and/or you can charge a device with it directly. The flex regulator plugs into the solar panel and adjusts, using its micro-controller, to whatever device you choose to charge. By itself it's only powerful enough to charge smaller electronics. However, you can daisy-chain more solar panels and use 6- or 12-volt flex regulators (not included) to charge up larger batteries (i.e.--car, motorcycle, boat, ATV, etc.). This is especially useful for hard-core backwoods hikers, bikers or world travelers.<br /><br />The flashlight has three brightness levels and a strobe light. If you do not click it to a lower light level within three seconds, it will stay at whatever level you currently have on it. It will then turn off, when you click it again. The strobe could be used for emergencies, or on the front of a bicycle at night. DO NOT aim it toward anyone, as it can temporarily blind them. Each light level runs the flashlight's lithium-ion battery down at a different rate. For example the brightest light, 250 lumens, will last around 4 hours, while the strobe will last around 120 hours. One not-so-good thing is that, if you run the flashlight long enough, it gets uncomfortably hot in your hand. This can be annoying, but lowering the brightness will cool it off. On the plus side, though, it could warm you up on a cold day.<br /><br />On the bottom of the flashlight is a battery pack with a 5-volt USB port that can be used to charge or run a device. Its a one amp port that stores 11 watt hours. Of course, device charging times and results will vary, depending on what you charge. The manufacturer says it will charge a smart phone roughly 2 times, but it charged my iPhone 3 times before running out of juice. Charging times vary also for the flashlight, depending on how much it is run down. The LED in the flashlight blinks red while charging, and then turns solid green when fully charged. When you push the button to turn on the battery pack, it will have a solid green LED that changes to red when it gets below 80% capacity. The manufacturer says a fully discharged flashlight will charge in about 4 1/2 hours when the solar panel is working at maximum capacity. However, it took about 6 hours for me to charge the flashlight, because I had to keep adjusting the angle of the panel to follow the sun. They claim the light will charge using a 3.0 USB port on a laptop in about 3 hours; it took me 4 hours using my 2.0 USB port.<br /><br />Overall, I found this XGS9 set quite useful. It is versatile; everything is rugged enough for travel, and it meets the relentless need to keep connected to the world through your devices.",[],B00H36XXE4,B00H36XXE4,AF2ACCKOTUKHIGCZHGHSZXMJDTKQ,1413684714000,1,False

It looked like the second box had probably been returned by someone else and Amazon is just reshipping these things to the next person who orders.

I expected for me to able to look at my data and for it to also show up on my Fitbit app. The problem is that I have to have the app open for it to track my activity. Even then you have to be kind of active on it for it to stay connected. Let's say you've been pedaling off and on for 2-3 days, when you open the app and connect it... it'll have all the activity you did in those 2-3 days and input it and make it seem like you did all of that, that same day/moment.

5.0,Promising option for a winter season,"[[VIDEOID:43a3d1c2cb03507b25c712f222f30aad]] I have been looking for a replacement or my old goggles, so many choices. Decided to give this one  a try, the title had most of the features I was looking for: anti-fog, polarizing, large, with a possibility of lens change. When I tried them on, I also looked for a form yet soft (no traces on the nose bridge or under the eyes), no pressure on the sinuses. So far so good, feel very comfortable, the broad adjustable band has a really wide range, there is an option to fit hem well on any hat, and even over the hood.

4.0,ALMOST 5 Stars.,"I really do like this product.  I've ridden my bike to the grocery store twice since getting a pair, and I have to say there are not too many drawbacks.  They are mesh, so the clerk can see in them, and not think you're stealing something as you load them up. The clerk loved that she didn't have to bag anything!  I love that they come on and off the rack easily, so I can bring them into the store with me. I like that they fold quite compactly when I'm not using them, and I love the shoulder straps.  I also like that the bottom hook can be moved forward or backward depending on where I put them on the rack, so that it doesn't hit my foot when I pedal.  I like that the hooks are coated in plastic, so they don't scratch the powder coat off my Trailrack.<br /><br />For the price, they are exactly what they need to be. And they hold A LOT! For $5 more I would've liked a stuff-sack type drawstring closure on the top. I'm thinking REI sells a stuff sack that is big enough to put inside and use on windy or wet days so things don't get damp from potential rain.  This would also prevent things from bouncing out over the two rail road crossings I have between home and grocery store, or if I use them on bumpy dirt roads etc.  The frame is weird, it doesn't exactly fit across the basket into the little pocket on the inside, but it does help the basket stay rigid when it has stuff in it.  That is why it's not 5 stars. BUT that is not a deal breaker for me, or any reason not to like them or reason to return them, for me.<br /><br />My second trip I came home with this: half gallon of ice cream, two small boxes of frozen veggies, a large tray of chicken, (8x12""), a standard size tray of steak, a tray of ground turkey, a bag of fresh parsley, a 1lb bag of mozzarella, two cans of crescent rolls, a bottle of ketchup and a bottle of mustard.  All of it fit in one bag, but I split it into two to distribute the weight.<br /><br />I have no doubt that the pair will be big enough to carry suits, towels snacks and drinks for a full day at the pond or a picnic a the park without problems.<br /><br />I would've liked a couple d-rings at the outside corners along the top edge so I can hook my cargo net over it.<br /><br />Overall I do like the product, a lot, and it was worth every penny.  They are a heavy weight material and seem like they will hold up well over time.  I imagine they will pay for themselves within a year of not having to drive to the grocery store in the spring/summer/fall months and use all that fuel.",[],B00165Q8ZO,B00165Q8ZO,AH5HBA76JNM2MTAU7IJGFXEQEQAQ,1345475385000,0,True

1.0,3 out of 4 mirrors were severely scratched up,"I’ve ordered a left+right combo now twice from these folks. Out of them only one right mirror came with no scratches. The rest looked like the included picture.<br /><br />The left side mirrors were both so bad as to be complete non-starters with a number of deep, straight scratches—which is a shame because left side is all I really needed. The right side was just to balance the looks. Even one of the right side mirrors was covered with spiral scratches that jumped out if it got the slightest level of glare.<br /><br />But importantly, one right mirror was completely and totally clear, even though its packaging was damaged worse than the others. So that means they probably come from the factory that way rather than getting scratched during manufacture, and the rest happened afterwards.<br /><br />It’s easy to see how:<br /><br />The mirrors have no protective film on the glass and rattle around freely in their cardboard box. The box itself isn’t sealed whatsoever and has no inserts to keep it from deforming. They ship them in envelopes where the box pops open when it’s squished (see my other picture) and the mirror falls out into the envelope. There’s also a smaller box for the mount unsecured inside the bigger box, and that rubs up against the mirror as it bounces around too.<br /><br />But none of those would explain the white road dust scuffs on the back of one mirror I received, so that one was plainly used. And I bet the other two were too.<br /><br />And for something claiming to be *glass* it apparently picks up scratches deep enough to catch my fingernail awfully easily.<br /><br />That’s not a coating getting scratched, and real glass doesn’t scratch when cleaned or even through abuse without a fair amount of effort. Most of these scratches are spiral, and so look like someone cleaned it with a paper towel or their shirt—which still shouldn’t hurt uncoated glass.<br /><br />I’m inclined to believe the review saying they’re plastic. They’re flat with minimal distortion, but at least the outermost layer seems to be something more fragile than glass.<br /><br />So I’ll waste a bunch of time returning four mirrors because I refuse to install something that banged up as new, and who needs just a single right mirror in the US? And I won’t be buying any Hafney mirrors ever again I can’t look at in a store first.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gS3isBouL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gS3isBouL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gS3isBouL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iVc-xZ6SL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iVc-xZ6SL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iVc-xZ6SL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07PDDLZXW,B099NYQVVV,AGE4XWNFW2OOVZY343RHKJTH2DBA,1661385142665,0,True

4.0,A decent tent for casual camping,"This is a decent 3-season tent for the casual camper.  IMHO, it is not light or compact enough for lengthy backpacking, but is good when those are not the prime considerations.  Materials are mid-range; a pricey tent will have more robust fabric and zippers.  It is roomy, but like most tents, it is a little over-rated. 3-person, unless there are some small ones.  The vestibule under the fly does provide some protected cover for gear if the tent is crowded.  The fly fits fairly close to the tent, as the corner anchors for the fly are the same as the tent itself.  I was worried that might lead to leaking.  I have had it in one light rain, and there were no moisture issues.  It does not come with a footprint, cut one from Tyvek if you want one (a good idea).","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51jaSZ+lcRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51jaSZ+lcRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51jaSZ+lcRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51sO2c906HL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51sO2c906HL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51sO2c906HL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71VKSpu0XJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71VKSpu0XJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71VKSpu0XJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fPSYTLXJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fPSYTLXJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fPSYTLXJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gDVkbRk8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gDVkbRk8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gDVkbRk8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yA0Emg4mL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yA0Emg4mL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yA0Emg4mL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09VDCLC38,B0BGXF4KBV,AF24OKOUJTQ7E56N5HMEM6DV3YZQ,1662420589138,2,False

5.0,Very Good For Coffee,"I found this mug while browsing at REI (same price as Amazon).  I happen to like very hot coffee.  In a regular ceramic mug, the coffee starts out hot but cools down quickly, so the bottom half of the coffee is lukewarm.  I made a cup by first, heating the mug by filling it and the pour over with boiling water.  (If you just brew coffee without pre-heating the mug, much of the heat will be lost in heating up a cold mug.)  The coffee stayed hot for the hour it took me to drink it, which is about what I expected.  It did cool down a bit after 30 minutes but it was still hot enough for me.  It's a big improvement over a regular ceramic coffee mug, where the coffee is lukewarm after 10 minutes or so.  The store display said, ""Keeps your coffee hot for six hours.""  That's an exaggeration.  It may keep coffee hot for six hours...in Death Valley in July.  I think one hour is closer to the truth. The mug seems well insulated, evidenced by the outside surface staying cold with boiling - temperature liquid in it.  The surface texture is great & provides a good non-slip surface.  The lid fits snugly & the opening for sipping is just right.  There is a line near the top of the mug, which I think indicates the maximum fill level, since the lid is rather thick.

Clear video feed makes for less crashes!<br /><br />The batteries have shown to show consistent internal resistance after multiple charges. I have not been able to test whether they really do 80C, but with my current usage I have not witnessed any power sag during high thrust maneuvers.

As soon as the Charge 2 was paired, it stated that it needed to update...then was unable to update.  I tried again and again, then went to the support page and went through the support process that included multiple resets of the device itself.  After not being able to pair and update the Charge 2 on the laptop, my Android phone, or with a Samsung Galaxy tablet, I then requested a return from Amazon which went smoothly and a new one was at our doorstep within a few days.<br /><br />Fast forward to the unboxing of the new, replacement Charge 2, I erased my account that I created for the previous defective device then reinstalled the app and recreated an account.  The new Charge 2 paired successfully then stated it needed to update....then the update failed! I called Customer Service at Fitbit and spent 45 minutes resetting everything including accounts and they determined this Fitbit was also defective and they are sending a new one in 7 days.<br /><br />I've personally invested over 4 hours in trying to get these things to work, and mind you, this was a present for my 9-year-old son's birthday and two Charge 2s have failed within a week of each other.

It came early this morning via UPS, I've already given it a good full charge, read all the pertinent information on the website, and have a solid understanding (I believe) of what I needed to do - and have done - to set it up and get to using it.  Right off the bat I began counting my steps:  The first 30 steps recorded as 84 steps.  Ten more steps (which put me at 40) recorded as (a new total of) 106.  It does say STEPS, not feet.  Hmm.  Will definitely add to this update, but it looks like a cheapy $5 pedometer would have been as accurate for step count (heck, I think Google and Apple have apps available for free that couldn't be worse - I mean, this thing was wayyy off!).

However, you can catch big fish with light line by using the long and tapered action of these poles. My daughter and I had a blast catching mangrove snappers and catfish off our dock last night. The bobbers, hook  and the weighted line are perfect for panfishing, and you can catch surprising large fish if you don't jerk it hard and break the line.

I had to open up a mylar blanket to make it through the night.<br /><br />Features:<br />The stash pocket was definitely useful for putting my phone/headlamp into for quick access and to keep them warm in the cold temps. The dual zipper functionality is also pretty sweet since it allows me to just open up a little by wherever I feel is getting too hot.<br /><br />I don't plan on using this for long term trips, just single or maybe double over nighters, and shorter distances, so the weight and size aren't too big of issues for me.

I just slip it in the side of one of the cupboards in the kitchen after I wash them up after each use.

5.0,"Excellent elliptical, but NordicTrack's specs aren't exactly right","We really like this elliptical -- it is very stable and quiet, and has just about every feature we want. A couple of things to note: first, although the NordicTrack website says that the elliptical is 68"" long (and that is one of the reasons we bought it -- we have limited space in our exercise room), it is actually 80"" long. Second, the stride length is not adjustable as NordicTrack implies. The stride length changes as you use the incline, but that is not the same as being able to set the length to fit the height of the exerciser. That is not a big deal for my husband and me, because we are both average height (5'6"" and 5'10"") so the 20"" stride length is good for us. We bought from Sears to take advantage of a sale price and an additional discount for using our Sears credit card and saved about $150 (including delivery and setup). The display is great (but, as with many exercise machines, the heart rate grip monitors aren't accurate). We were happy to see that the elliptical has both a USB input (on the side of the console) and an HDMI input on the TV.  We are lukewarm about iFit and tend to just use the manual mode (same with our NordicTrack treadmill), so it is nice to be able to watch TV and online videos.

4.0,Exceptional Nighttime Recording- Mediocre Daytime Recording.  Acorn's 12MP  Scouting Cam.  A Critical Review.,"[[VIDEOID:458c1d4ca8a483ab01811abbf238d20b]] Update:<br /><br />I received an email stating that I was in error concerning the spec's and after double checking, he was absolutely right.<br /><br />The Scouting Cam is NOT 720P but 640 w/ an infrared lighting system built in. That's an important distinction which explains why the daytime shots were a bit fuzzy but the nighttime was world's away better than my other camcorders.<br /><br />When you watch the video, please excuse any reference to the Scouting Cam being 720.<br /><br />Original review follows.<br /><br />The Acorn ""LTL 5210A"" is both a phenomenal nighttime scouting camera that blew away the other 720 and 1080P cam's that I own, but daytime recording is pathetic.<br /><br />***<br /><br />The Scouting Camera is a 3- Camera recording system, featuring:<br /><br />* 12MP Digital Still Camera<br />* 5MP/ Standard Def. Video cam<br />* 12MP<br /><br />Still Image recording<br /><br />The still images are good but not great but I'm really impressed with night shots.<br /><br />For Video recording, you have two choices:<br /><br />-- Live (instant) recording<br />-- Sensor recording<br /><br />The standard definition recording is nothing to write home but in all honesty, you should always record in the highest definition and reduce the resolution to as needed. You can't upgrade a video image when the original recording is at a lower rate.<br />What's really impressive is the nighttime recording.<br /><br />My go-to cam is my Flip Mino HD (720), which is great for every day recording but nighttime recording is almost non-existing without an external lighting system.<br /><br />On occasion, I'd use the 1080P camera on my Samsung Note 3. The video image is stellar, not to mention the still images, but again nighttime recording is lacking.<br /><br />In the accompanying video, you can tell that nighttime recording is best with the Acorn.<br /><br />I took some night time shots at a pool in the backyard on July 4 around 9 pm. The Samsung clips were almost totally black but the Acorn was able to show some reasonably good resolution with little to no light.",[],B00873DB5S,B00873DB5S,AH4CMX6XQM7DLQ2PZWE5XMFX5GTQ,1404876402000,1,False

4.0,"Large volume hydration pack for hiking, running, camping.","I run a lot, and it gets hot here in the summer, so a hydration pack is always useful. I really wanted to review this Tactical 3L hydration pack to see how well it works. {I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest/unbiased opinion. I'm not affiliated with either the manufacturer or the seller of this product, and all comments are based upon my own personal experience with the item. Hopefully my review has helped you make a more informed purchasing decision.}<br /><br />The pack itself is sturdy nylon and seems well-made. There are broad padded straps for your shoulders, plus a waist and chest strap to keep the bag from bouncing around as you run or hike. The straps can be adjusted slightly - I'm very tall and it works for me, but not sure how it would work on a shorter person. There is also an outside pocket on the pack that can hold keys, phone, wallet, etc. which is useful if your running clothes don't have pockets.<br /><br />Inside the pack is a green plastic/rubber 3L (64oz) bladder to hold water. There is a large screw-cap for the fill-hole. The bladder has an insulated hose with a mouthpiece attached to the other end of it. I found the hose and mouthpiece a bit confusing, since it says &#34;twist&#34; and instead you actually have to pull it open. There are NO user instructions on placement or how-to included, which is a definite negative in my view. There's also no information included on a website URL to visit for more information (also a negative).<br /><br />The bladder for the water has a strong plastic -y smell and your water will taste bad if you don't rinse it out with hot water a few times before using.<br />The mouthpiece didn't work at first -- I finally figured out you have to bite down HARD to get the water to come out. That would have been nice to know up front (like - included in some user instructions, possibly??). The cap for the bladder does screw on very tightly and no water leaked in my use-tests.<br />Overall it's a decent pack so I'm giving it four stars. It holds a good amount of water, which is important in hot weather, and it works.I would recommend this hydration pack for hikers, campers and runners with the caveat that you may need to fiddle around with it for a while to really figure out how to use it.",[],B01F6JKPUO,B01F6JKPUO,AFA7JSANZA5OVQMAC4DH673MBCJQ,1466086978000,1,False

3.0,"Great compact size and bright for what it is, but not really super waterproof","I picked this up mostly for the kids, emergency home use and very light camping.  I wasn't getting it expecting to leave it exposed to the elements, although my kids my have other plans (or rather just not paying attention to what needs to come back into the house).  So with all that in mind, this light does the job.<br /><br />With all that said, I don't believe for a second that this is truly waterproof - or if it is, it's only to withstand a little rain and not submersion.  The rubber gaskets are very slight and, like any rubber, will decay over time.  I've owned truly waterproof items like this and the ones that work have thicker and more heavy duty gaskets than this.  To be blunt, if you want something that's truly waterproof you'll need to pay more, probably triple if not even more.  So this product's price should give you an indication of what to expect.<br /><br />Another issue I have with the light is the clear glass/plastic instead of frosted.  LED lights like this are very bright to look at.  Even with the fairly low lumens you will be blinded if you look directly at this light.  So that means at the brightest level you can't really put it on a table where people are seated.  You'll have to hang the light from above so that it casts the light more broadly.  And that's okay.  Except if they'd used frosted glass none of that would be an issue.<br /><br />And lastly, keep in mind that the top flashlight is very weak.  It's so dim that I can't imagine using it that way unless I specifically wanted to look around and keep the light dim in order to not wake up other people in the room or tent.  So the flashlight purpose is a bit limited from what I see.<br /><br />The light is very compact for what it offers and it's super easy to use.  I happen to love the size.  And for that reason alone I would give this four stars.  However, I'm a bit put off on the emphasis on calling this waterproof instead of water resistant.  I'm seeing a lot of claims like this when it comes to outdoor gear and it drives me a bit nuts.  I used to work for LL Bean and to me terms mean something.  I'm seeing tents being marketed as ""four season"" that are cheaply made and would be used only by kids in the summer.  So because of that I dropped my rating to 3 stars.  Your mileage may vary.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good light as other positive reviews claim.  I just don't think it's as hardcore as the marketing makes it out to be.",[],B07LBYNDGX,B07LBYNDGX,AGLOSDW6BQHIKTVEKCI23IAZCY7A,1617100293326,0,False

5.0,"For the price, it's a deal. For a 'life knife', it's not.","This knife's steel is inexpensive, it's sharp enough to hurt but not enough to shave with. After  short period sharpening, it's useful for rare daily uses; opening boxes, cutting cords, splitting hoses. The best point of this knife is the ease of opening. With a very gentle flick of the thumb, the blade is out and locked. No fighting with it, just whoosh and there it is. The 'seatbelt cutter' is fairly sharp (cut fingers) but that's not saying all that much; when I tried it on a material similar to a seatbelt, I found it would take a LONG time to cut through a seatbelt with it. For me, the blade is the only way to cut seatbelts. The metal prong at the end of the blade would be useful for breaking glass with a strong enough arm behind it. For woman or a child, it won't be much use against glass.<br /><br />As an actual 'firefighter' knife, it's not going to be useful. It's too weak and cheaply made for use as a device to help save lives. As a use once in a blue moon knife, it's great; but I have several others I trust for daily work. Is it a bad knife? Nope.

She had batting practice at the cages with a pitching machine today, on the  3rd pitch we heard a crack and the barrel of the bat went flying into the net. Only having the bat for 5 practices it has already broken in half at the handle. Demarini is a quality brand as I use their bats for an adult slowpitch softball league for years and i have not had a bat break on me yet.

4.0,2nd Blitzu light.  Very happy.,"I bought this light to replace a Blitzu headlight that's worked well for 5 years but finally won't hold a charge anymore.  In that 5 years, not a single car has jumped out in front of me having not seen me.  So I already have a positive impression of Blitzu.  The newer one is extremely bright, easy to mount, and solidly built.  I have a slight preference for the older mount because the light was easier to dismount for charging, and because it allowed a 90 degree turn so you could mount on the handlebars or  arrow bars.  The newer is oriented so it only works on the handlebars.<br /><br />The tail light is also bright and easy to mount/dismount, and with my previous positive experience with Blitzu I expect it to last.  Also, both lights use USB-C.<br /><br />I marked the whole light set down a star because of the flashing sequences on the tail light.  The headlight has  variety of choices including a simples, calm, on/off flash.  The tail light also has a variety reminiscent of an emergency vehicle but for some reason doesn't have that simple calm on/off.  Not a huge deal, but when riding in a pack, I'd rather not subject the person behind me a wild light sequence.",[],B00WSWBAFM,B00WSWBAFM,AFM42BHYUCQVMBUWGCX5XUUILZLQ,1668100203402,1,True

The milling inside of the cutouts is not smooth. This would not effect the putt however it brings into question the quality of the putter head in general. There has to be some give in quality for the price and it is in the milling of the putter head. That being said, most amateurs can putt with anything from a Walmart putter to a Scotty Cameron. For the budget conscious, you get a putter that is designed like the Taylormade Spider but that is where the similarities end.

I can see very clearly ahead at least 100 yards and probably more, and to the sides very well.

4.0,Great sleeping pad for most 3 season car camping!,"The OUTAD Sleeping Pad is a quality product for 3 season camping. While the bag itself is deemed ”self inflating” I did find that even when the main body of the pad is inflated it helps to puff a few breaths of air to help that pad loft a bit better. The pillow portion has to be filled with your own breath so that you can dial in the perfect pillow height for your over comfort.<br /><br />I am 6’0” tall and the pad fits just perfectly for me. I do have a wide chest and back and found that the pad was more than adequate to suit me. The pad also includes snaps to put two of them together for those that wish to cuddle.<br /><br />The pad also very easy to disinflate and store due to the handy clips. I was actually able to roll up the pad tighter than how it was shipped from the factory with ease. There is also a storage sack that helps keep the pad clean and dust free while storing.<br /><br />This pad would be great for car camping in most 3 season situations however at 3lbs+ you may want to look at a different pad for general backpacking.<br /><br />Some of the pros:<br />Well built with high quality materials<br />Relatively comfortable and should keep you warm in most 3 season situations<br />Easy to use, pack up, and store<br /><br />Some of the cons include:<br />Too slim for winter use<br />Much too Heavy for backpacking<br /><br />In closing I would like to say that this pad does have value in the right situation and can certainly keep up with the best. I also would like to add that I was provided this product free of charge in return for an honest review.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716SzoIfV5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716SzoIfV5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716SzoIfV5L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716SzoIfV5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716SzoIfV5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716SzoIfV5L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71x4hJZzPyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71x4hJZzPyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71x4hJZzPyL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816odknjMwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816odknjMwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816odknjMwL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WaGsPqH5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WaGsPqH5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WaGsPqH5L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B018VI37P2,B018VI37P2,AHMISG3JKKXCIDYGTUBDPXDLVQNA,1455637986000,0,False

5.0,Anything but basic! Great mat and case!,"Once again, Amazon goes above and beyond  and delivers on their own brand, ""AmazonBasic"" by offering this yoga mat at a truly great price! And although the label may have the word basic in it's name, this mat and included carry case are anything but. I'll start with the soft suede like surface which feels good against the skin and prevents abrasions that could occur on an all rubber topped mat. It's a much more comfortable experience when you're not sticking to a rubbery surface and instead have the cushioning and softness this mat offers.  The underside is textured and designed this way to stay in place during your workout. Amazon could have stopped there and I would have been more than pleased but they went further and printed the mat with a lovely and useful design. But perhaps what most impressed me was the included mesh and nylon carry case with adjustable shoulder strap. The included case is well made with reinforced stiching, quality mesh, and an easy to close drawstring that keeps the mat secure and ready for your next class. I'm happy to share that I can enthusiastically recommend this Amazon Basic Yoga Mat and hope that my experience, along with some photos I've posted, help you a bit with your choice. Thank you.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ygXlvxOiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ygXlvxOiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ygXlvxOiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-A-CU6GiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-A-CU6GiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-A-CU6GiL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715U8yHLZFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715U8yHLZFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715U8yHLZFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DMWgoGG8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DMWgoGG8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DMWgoGG8L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YVK45BFeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YVK45BFeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YVK45BFeL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gbNNxyPCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gbNNxyPCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gbNNxyPCL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71idzizOwgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71idzizOwgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71idzizOwgL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pGXQMfU-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pGXQMfU-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pGXQMfU-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81VnqP4vZcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81VnqP4vZcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81VnqP4vZcL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07RCNH9F2,B07RCNH9F2,AEVICAPFFUAG22APKGF5ORLXLENA,1571074748149,5,False

4.0,Easy to use!,"Took this boat out for the first time today and it was great! I had tested out the inflation in my back yard prior to taking it out and it was even easier the second time, took less than 10 minutes. Once out on the water, I found it a little bit difficult to maneuver because it was so light. One push of the paddle sent me far to one side or the other. I think next time I will use the included skeg to help it track better. I don't plan on using it on long trips, just recreational kayaking for an hour or two so it's perfect for what I need. Can't beat the price for a kayak, especially for a user like me that will only use it occasionally on the weekends. Deflating was easy but but getting it back in the bag can be difficult if you don't have the patience to allow it to deflate all the way. The one thing I didn't like about it was that it was difficult to get the water out of the bottom of it because it rolls to the front or back of the boat. I was able to dump it with assistance but I would not have been able to by myself. But, I repeat, you can not beat the price and it was highly functional and fun, perfect for what I need!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812lYWJUJoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812lYWJUJoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812lYWJUJoL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lLS9zXVEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lLS9zXVEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lLS9zXVEL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00177J4JS,B0B62CKP3B,AEUDWVUFXSW3UQWCYOR7J3FL2RWA,1567979263683,0,True

On our third night it started to rain, it rained hard all night long. The only water intrusion we had was on the floor below the zippers. We'll remember to bring a couple extra towels next time. A larger section over the entrance would probably take care of that problem.

4.0,"Pinched Fingers & Initial Frustration, But Preassembled, Sturdy & Quality Product",":UPDATE: Took it into the field today and the results are in!<br /><br />This is the first bench I've ever had, so I can't compare it to anything. However, I really like it! I found it to be extremely comfortable, secure and supportive. Apparently 3-point benches are better suited for uneven terrain, but I was able to dig these four legs into the soil for a totter-free setup with minimal effort.<br /><br />I did find the front gun rest to be a bit too low, even at its highest setting. I returned home and whipped up an extension that gets the front of the gun supported nice 'n' high. Shooting will be even better now. I'm 5'11"" and found it too low. YMMV.<br /><br />:END UPDATE:<br /><br />Arrived today in a retail cardboard box inside a wholesale plain brown cardboard box. Moderate shipping damage to the cardboard, but the bench survived intact.<br /><br />Surprised to find it pre-assembled and ready to unfold for use.<br /><br />The bench is relatively heavy. The UPS package said 47lbs and that seems accurate. You can carry it from your truck to the range, but that's about all.<br /><br />The bench folds up on itself and is maybe 2-4"" thick when collapsed. It complicatedly and frustratingly unfolds to a quality, sturdy bench. It will take several attempts to learn how to quickly and efficiently set it up. It is very much a puzzle to figure out what goes where, what locks-in and what rests against what. Expect some pinched and bleeding fingers. It's just too heavy to have all those pinch-points. After you've learned the steps that work best for you, I'm sure it's gravy and will become a worthwhile investment.<br /><br />I was surprised to see the quality embossing on the seat and the barrel rest itself adjusts in any dimension to accommodate the shooter.<br /><br />The table is a soft felt type material and is in perfect condition, as was the seat.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-fnljcwpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-fnljcwpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-fnljcwpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XLCazwP5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XLCazwP5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XLCazwP5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BVbwW6VXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BVbwW6VXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BVbwW6VXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hs0ceYJEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hs0ceYJEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hs0ceYJEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B000TTILDU,B000TTILDU,AFAQSP3WDEG3SO5TFOQX5JZFSS6A,1345236672000,3,True

I tell her about the importance of setting a good example for her teammates and she is in the group of girls that starts the match, leads the team cheer, and is responsible for handing out the snacks to each of her teammates.<br /><br />I've not noticed any problem with the quality of the material.  It is a little large one a few of my girls but fits just right on some of the others.  All in all though I would say it is a tad large for U6 (U6 girls anyway), but with the jersey sleeve tucked underneath it hasn't really caused any problems and the girls are really excited when it is their week to wear it.

They have very small holes punched in the leather by New Balance instead. These little holes turned out to be too small for the No Tie Shoelaces. I couldn't get the tip through the hole. So, although I am sure the No Tie Shoelaces are great when they work, sadly they didn't work for me. I chose 3 stars because it's really not the manufacturers' fault that my shoes are like this. But also I didn't get to try them so I am kind of disappointed at the moment.

4.0,Nice paddle board. Stores easy in motorhome,I received this in just a few days and on first use didn’t pump it up enough because I wasn’t sure how many pounds of pressure I had in it because the pressure gauge didn’t read the pressure until I got over 11 or so pounds. I just thought it didn’t work so when the board felt full and sturdy I stopped. The second time I had read more feed back and learned it takes a bit of elbow grease to pump up to recommended pressure. At that point the gauge started working and I got a pretty good work out pumping it up so I’m going to get a automatic pump for sure. When it was to correct pressure it was a huge difference in rigidity and sturdiness.  A few pounds makes a world of difference.  After the first use my back pack ripped and that issue was addressed in a prior review so I knew exactly what to do from the other reviewer. I called the company and they mailed a new back pack immediately. They had a batch with poor seams and said the new back pack would be much better.  All in all I’m happy with my choice. It has a go pro mount on it and I wanted that.  I just need to stand up without falling more than not and I’ll be really happy.,[],B07M7YVRSN,B07M7YVRSN,AGIS5Z3HQMNFNYIXBPLE4TFNARWA,1596301746082,2,True

4.0,"Cheap break pads, a bit heavy for a single-speed bike","I had to purchase it after my previous single-speed bike had been stolen. And I can't help comparing them.<br />A couple of facts about quality:<br />- the plastic chain cover was touching the chain, had to remove it (though, I would have done it anyway, but tells about quality)<br />- the break pads are somewhat cheap and they squeal mercilessly - the first time in my experience when it is a) as loud as a terrified pig b) would not go away after some time cycling - still hope it will<br /><br />If you got used to an average light weight bike, this one will seem heavy. And the bar is pretty wide, wider than I got used to. The break handles are also a bit bigger and stand farther from the bar.<br /><br />And it has 700x28 tires with inflation up to 70 PSI, not 25 and up to 100PSI, as it usually is when it is about fast riding.<br /><br />The rest is fine, I like the additional mechanism helping to set up the chain tension.<br /><br />The overall impression is that this is not a single-speed / fixie bike for real enthusiasts of this type. This is a very moderate version for those who love the idea, but prefer a more comfortable and relaxed riding.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Y3IgJ3srL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Y3IgJ3srL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Y3IgJ3srL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718rgmFsVSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718rgmFsVSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718rgmFsVSL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TM2bp-utL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TM2bp-utL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TM2bp-utL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71m9o8TSCQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71m9o8TSCQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71m9o8TSCQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mAy6Xo37L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mAy6Xo37L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mAy6Xo37L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812JWefNj4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812JWefNj4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812JWefNj4L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818F7oAYt6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818F7oAYt6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818F7oAYt6L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B06XXDSKTG,B08HF529NJ,AEXQGHOHGEWUTTJRQB6LLRHXPBSQ,1593023996495,5,True

3.0,Could not see much of a difference,"I hadn’t noticed how much the grooves in my irons had worn until I started using the LZFAN Golf Club Groove Sharpening Kit.  My clubs are about eleven years old, I play roughly thirty times a year, plus I do practice on the driving range and chipping area so I shouldn’t have been surprised.<br /><br />I felt the sharpening tool carrying case didn’t represent the quality of the tool itself because it was only made out of thin plastic.  The sharpening tool is a very nice knurled metal body that contains the sharpening tool protected when screwed shut.  To use the tool, it’s simply a matter of unscrewing the tool, flipping it around, and then re-screwing it back into the tool cover.<br /><br />Before trying to sharpen the grooves I gave two clubs (Calloway lob wedge and Adam’s Golf gap wedge) an extra strong cleaning using water and a brass wire brush.  Satisfied they were clean of grass and mud I got to work.  Since sharpening the grooves involved cutting metal I tried both regular oil and WD-40 as a lubricant.  I also tried pulling the sharpening tool through the groove, pushing the tool, and both light and heavy force.<br /><br />On the Calloway lob wedge I did not see any difference in the grooves.  That could be because the grooves were worn down so much the cutting tool wasn’t even touching the groove edges (I did try every cutting tool shape).  For the Adam’s Golf gap wedge, I saw some metal files and a very minor change on some of the grooves.  What’s not yet clear is will that make any difference out on the course.<br /><br />Note: As you can see in the photos I inspected the grooves under a magnifying lamp.  The before photo for each club is the first one posted and the after sharpening is the second one.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61owWCzLRtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61owWCzLRtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61owWCzLRtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KN3qiol6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KN3qiol6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KN3qiol6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ldE-B-ryL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ldE-B-ryL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ldE-B-ryL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pnlAqqBkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pnlAqqBkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pnlAqqBkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pnlAqqBkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pnlAqqBkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pnlAqqBkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71w3PTKjxpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71w3PTKjxpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71w3PTKjxpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HUXXXB8VL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HUXXXB8VL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HUXXXB8VL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BM489K8B,B0B9RSPCWT,AF5LSEK3RE6ZHG4IL3ECHFXRWKUQ,1675997787514,0,False

Thankfully this was while I was at home and I was able to find it.<br /><br />My only other negative is right out of the box there aren't really any directions on how to get your device set up and get started.

5.0,Solid Quality.,"I have not had to inflate this yet fortunately, so cannot comment on that. It does have a manual inflation tube. However, the quality on this appears to be pretty good. The web belt is wider and heavier than the other popular brand. The belt connector is a nice set of heavy stainless square links vice the typical plastic snap lock type. It also comes with a heavy duty stainless D link on the belt.The D link should have been put on the back side however. That's because if were to be used for a helicopter hoist you want the weight of your body bending you forward not backwards. It's still good to have though.In either case, as it is now, you would slide the belt up so that it came up to your armpits. The jacket also comes with sewn in reflective strips, so in all this is a serious lifejacket. Deserves credit where due.",[],B06ZY9K16V,B00S4PO90A,AEBUYGSSXULYISYO5RRBVC7ERVYQ,1503356058400,5,True
4.0,"Bodybuilder, Using This During Cutting","Wow is all I really have to say at first.  I am an avid gym-goer and love spending my days with the weights.  I have been lifting weights for many years now, and love working on my body composition.  When I am trying to bulk up, I run into the same exact problem that every other person who loves bulking goes through, and that is adding some fat to my frame due to the increase in caloric intake.  Normally, I dabble in some high intensity training, or go out and do a strict dieting plan, but in both cases, I felt that I wasn't maximizing my workouts to prevent any loss of muscle during my cutting.<br /><br />A fellow gym-goer started to describe this DVD set to me, and my first guess to the name was the common 'p90x'.  Surprisingly, he told me that not only was I wrong, but that I was in store for one of the most punishing workouts of my life.  I was pumped, and couldn't wait to try it.<br /><br />The workout schedule is fantastic.  You start your regimen with a bi-weekly fit test to ensure that you are making personal gains on workouts.  Each day has its own particular kind of workout dvd that you use, each with varying target muscle groups, and exercise types, from plyometrics, to high intensity training, to full force cardio.  Each workout program can go anywhere from 30 minutes to 45 minutes, but dont let that discourage you as that includes a warmup and a very good stretching session.<br /><br />Now I particularly think of myself as in good shape, but wow, did this thing beat me up!  I admit that the first day I went into this thing with an insane sense of pride, and pushed myself to the limits ..... and i ended up paying for it with a quick run to bathroom to ""upchuck""..... and yes .... this was during the fit test!!!  But what has that taught me?  Pace yourself!  Do not get discouraged, and do NOT feel like you have to follow the same speed that the folks on the DVD are going at.  Pace yourself and make sure you keep that form nice and tight and you will surely see some results.  Don't get too proud and drain yourself of all energy within the first 5 minutes.  Remember that every-body is different, and do not feel down if you are not keeping up at the same speed ... that is far from the point of the entire program.<br /><br />I highly recommend this program.  At first I was skeptical with these 'at-home' programs and felt it was for the ""stay at home mom"" types, but again, that was me and my stubborn pride and years of thinking ""fat loss comes from the gym"".  If you are in the same boat that I was, trust me, give this a shot, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />The only ""Con"" that I give, is that man I wish there were some good tunes to rock out to instead of the typical instrumentals that you find on these workout videos.  But hey, that's my personal preference :)",[],B002QZ1RS6,B002QZ1RS6,AG5IXGPMO5QQCLJ65CSWR675K5GA,1328722041000,6,True

5.0,Works Inside or Outside,"The setup was straightforward, but because of the springs it takes some serious strength to get them in place. After that though, the kids went absolutely nuts with this thing and had a blast. It is big enough for a least 2 boys (Ages 3 and 2), although I think at least 1 more would fit, with a max probably being about 4 depending on their age and relative size.<br /><br />The basketball hoop as well as the dartboard are really cool additions and keep things interesting for the kids. My children have a LOT of toys of varying types, but I have not gotten as big of a reaction as I did for this.<br /><br />If you figure in the cost of a large outdoor trampoline and the fact they are not able to be used indoors, this seems like a no-brainer. We have set it up in a spare room and it can be used whenever. In general everything seems pretty solid as well so it should hold up to some abuse from the kids.<br /><br />Would recommend.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BgsWUXtTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BgsWUXtTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BgsWUXtTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bDUENPmbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bDUENPmbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bDUENPmbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81bN1sO+HnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81bN1sO+HnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81bN1sO+HnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81rayTPQ8nL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81rayTPQ8nL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81rayTPQ8nL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B99D88DK,B0BNHSKP99,AEQMNFUOMJI6S5N2PZZNOFQYABCQ,1667221263625,1,False

5.0,Very nice product.,"I recently received this and was very impressed by the quality. I have owned several of this style of net and typically the material is very thin and weak and will break after/rip after a few hours of use. This seems much thicker and looks like it will last several seasons. I was even impressed with the Velcro on the numbers side because it has Velcro to hold it up, and down so wind wont flip it up. I will say that collapsing it isn't as easy as the instructions make it but still very doable. The three pockets you aim for are separate from each other so you can count how many you got in each hole.

My facility is 2100 sq/ft and I want to use every inch of it to help athlete's get faster and stronger.  That can't be done when there's a bunch of speed agility &#34;toys/tools&#34; being stored on the training floor or taking  up space (awkwardly) in a back room or storage closet.  Being able to flatten them completely and put them into the provided storage bag keeps things simple, clean, and out of the way.  This also make it perfect to go on site to do demo's or training sessions outside of our facility.  As soon as I opened the box and tried these out I immediately went and ordered more!",[],B01K38HU6U,B01K38HU6U,AFH6ZTORMICUX6UDCE2ACB52BLIA,1483950484000,24,True

3.0,This rack does the job at a good price,"This plate rack does what it is intended to do -- hold your free weight plates.  That said, the metal is of some cheap quality (you get what you pay for).  Be careful when bolting down the feet; I over-tightened the bolts and it bent the metal inward.  Even though the metal is bent, the rack still sits fine, but just be warned that if you don't tighten both feet at equal level, the rack will wobble a bit.  Also, even though the holes are cut square for the square bolts, over-tightening can actually round out the slot, that is how soft the metal is (which leads to a bolt that will never fully tighten.  Who knows how long this thing will hold up.

2.0,Not impressed at all,"Heavy, bulky bag--not for backpackers.  Lining is all cotton flannel, which is not a very good idea for real cold weather use (cotton retains moisture like no other fabric, and moisture promotes evaporative cooling, which is why you are always cold if you are wet even when it's hot out).  Each night you spend in this bag the liner will progressively retain more of your sweat (moisture), and thus you'll get progressively colder until you dry it out in a warm environment.  I'm a bit over 6'2&#34; and the bag was too short for me by an inch or so, and the zipper did not come up over my shoulders (thus creating entry points for cold air.)  Finally, there is a lot of empty space in the foot area--some people may like this, but it's not very efficient from a heat retention standpoint.  In my opinion the bag is over-priced for what it is, and I think there is little chance it will keep you warm in sub-zero weather unless you are dressed in down pajamas.

4.0,Could Use Better Ropes,"The &#34;Adventure Hammock - Made of Parachute Nylon and Folds Into Small Carry Bag&#34; will do the trick for a hammock, but you will probably want to get hammock straps to really enhance your ability to use this hammock.  There were no instructions on how to set up the hammock, but thankfully I had a friend with me to “show me the ropes” (haha).  If you are not as fortunate and are unfamiliar with how to set up a hammock, you should look it up online first.  This hammock does come with ropes, but they are pretty short.  So I will be getting hammock tree straps to be able to use this hammock in more locations. Otherwise you have to be limited to only trees that are close enough together.  Other than the straps issue, this is a sturdy hammock and well made.  It is triple sticked and I felt really secure when sitting in it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LaFqn0kQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LaFqn0kQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LaFqn0kQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01L9WN14O,B01L9WN14O,AFJNUFPKBYEOHYTKT3UDT3FGDQZA,1475171479000,1,False

3.0,Basic Foldable scooter - not the worst or best,"This is a very basic, entry level foldable scooter. It's built with the quality for someone who is just checking out two wheeled scooters to see if they are right for you.<br /><br />Unboxing:<br />It all came fully assembled, but folded. It took relatively little effort to figure out how to unpack it, although it did take a couple of swear words figuring it out the first time. I can understand other's complaints about the folding/unfolding process. It was a little tricky the first couple times. At times, it felt like I might get a finger pinched. I didn't, but the build quality did feel a little less than what I would hope.<br /><br />Quality:<br />Not terrible, but definitely not the highest. Lots of metal parts, which is nice - and it is still pretty light. I wish the tires/wheels were a little more heavy duty and maybe slightly wider. The tires are probably less than an inch wide and it would be easy to get stuck around large cracks or railroad crossings (SO BE CAREFUL).<br /><br />The Ride:<br />It's relatively smooth with some shocks helping keep things smooth. But the tires are pretty hardened plastic which will wear out after lots of continuous usage. Even with the shocks, you do get some pretty good vibrations coming through your legs.<br /><br />Who this is for:<br />Someone with occasional short transit needs - like between public transit dropoffs/pickups and final destination.<br /><br />Who this is not for:<br />Someone looking for a high quality scooter with replaceable parts as they wear.",[],B08CF2GX6Y,B08CF2GX6Y,AHCSOINU2KOXVBOAXKZHGSXZAEFA,1625513192013,0,False

5.0,Cost effective alternatives to snow pants,He's like covers are pretty cool. My husband and I are landscapers and we also do snow removal.

I really like that they have cinch straps that adjust based on how big or small you need him and it is very good at keeping out the water and snow from your shoes. I don't know how I lived without these before because now I don't have to worry about wet socks. When you're a big person if you can't find coveralls or snow pants and if you by chance to find them they're extremely expensive. This is a cost-effective alternative that does pretty much the same thing the only difference is is it's it doesn't cover your whole entire legs. Is a really nice to have and I recommend everybody purchase a pair specially if you have to walk through deep snow at any point in time during the winter.

I like how small and light it is, which makes it a great and convenient addition to my backpacking gear for camping or emergencies where I have run out of water! I tested this filter at home with water I had gotten from a creek earlier that day. Reason for me to do this was to be home safe and sound in the case that the Sawyer Mini could not filter the muddy/merky creek water.<br /><br />Im a backpacker so i like to keep my pack weight down and the mini was supposed to be a great replacement for my katadyn water filter.

2.0,Questionable Durability for accessories,"Used this in the summer time for a hike;  immediately lost one of the accessory boots because the attachment method is not secure.  The boots will just slip off if they get slightly caught up in any crack or rock or root on the trail.  Also, no matter how tight I tried to make the pole extension snaps, if I put enough weight on it the pole would slip backward requiring re-adjustment.<br /><br />I used these poles yesterday hiking up a snow covered mountain;  near the top where it was -12C and high winds, both snow baskets cracked at the threads and ripped off the pole bottoms where they screw in.  They could not take a single hike up in the snow without breaking, and left me in dire straights when we hit the top of the mountain  where there was 3 feet+ of snow and so the poles kept sinking in deep, giving me no purchase to continue to push upwards.  I made it to the top nevertheless, worse for wear. Terrible experience.  I'm conflicted between replacing the snow baskets, knowing they will just break again at the most inopportune time.<br /><br />I'd say if you're just walking on flat trails without many divots and rocks, and not in the snow, these might be poles for you.  However if you are at all an outdoors sporting individual who pushes themselves and their equipment, I would not rely on these poles as they left me almost stranded at the worse possible time.

5.0,"Great battery life, really waterproof!","I've now had my tracker for 9 months and the original battery is still going strong.  I keep this on 24/7 and have had no issues.  I wear it in the shower, it's been in the pool all summer, in the ocean, and rafting down rivers - it is definitely waterproof.  I use it to track my steps and it does an excellent job of that.  I like that the time is always displayed, so I don't need a separate watch.  This tracker does a decent job of calculating my sleep - sometimes I have to manually adjust my sleep time if I've spent time stationary, reading a book before bed - it thinks I've already gone to sleep.  I find the app fairly easy to navigate.  I've only had sync issues 2-3 times in 9 months.  Both times I turned off my phone bluetooth, stopped the app, turned back on the bluetooth, reopened the app, and was able to sync.  I have it set to sync only when I manually do press the sync button on the device to save power.  I purchased the Vivofit Alexandria bands [[ASIN:B01C3SRJT6 Garmin vívofit 3 Accessory Bands - Style Collection - Alexandra]] to go with my tracker and love not having to worry about clasps - I'm fairly active and tend to break clasps on anything.

3.0,Cool concept but not the most practical,"I bought three of these for our family's Hawaii trip recently. Overall it's a cool concept but found them to only be good when you are near shore or have easy access to a flotation device nearby. The reason is that they have a tendency to fog up even with anti fog product applied to the inside from all the breathing and once you try to take it off to clear it with water - it is next to impossible to get going again. This is due to it being difficult to clear the water out of the mask and usually while you are treading water with it off, you start breathing heavier which results in it being impossible to catch your breath in the mask. I believe the real flaw here is that its too difficult to breath through and when you have nice even breaths it works fine but everything goes to hell the minute you breath harder. I believe this is mentioned by other reviewers so isn't a surprise but it is very difficult to dive under the water with due to the air pocket around your face trying to float. Also the pressure quickly builds up around the mask which resulted in me only getting about four or five feet down before coming back up.<br /><br />By the end of the vacation, my whole family had stopped using these to use $15 ones we bought at the beach.",[],B01K3Q178O,B01K3Q178O,AGULMDLBKDJ7KKPLSEBNFVR4GBDQ,1490039433000,5,True

The vestibules are a decent size but I would not complain if they were a tiny bit larger. The tent has a &#34;stargazing&#34; fly that you can pull back on one side to look out at the stars.

The inside of the tent has a couple of pockets towards the bottom and two toward the top that are supposed to be used to throw a flashlight or headlamp in to ligh up the tent. Although we had a lantern and hung it from the center of the tent, I did store my headlamp in one of the upper pockets so I could easily find it. The tent also comes with a gearloft. I was a little disappointed to find that you have to tie the loft into place. I think I will get 3 small aluminum carabiners and tie the loft to them so I can clip the loft in place and not have to tie and untie it all the time. The tent comes with some great accessories. It comes with a foot print and also some very nice Kelty &#34;nobendium&#34; stakes. True to their name, these aluminum stakes did not bend or break. I can see these being the only stakes we would ever need unless we lose them. They were far better than the aluminum stakes from Walmart that my sister in law brought with her. One of the Walmart stakes got stuck in the ground and broke when we tried to remove it. As far as space goes the three man tent is a good size for two people. You could sleep three but not with any gear inside. This tent did fit a queen size air mattress in it but there was only about a foot of space on the top and one side. If you plan on car camping and using an airmatress, I would recommend the four person tent. If you are using individual camping pads this tent is perfect. We haven't backpacked with this tent yet but it is pretty light and I think it would be a great tent for that. I like that the tent packs up into a nice rectangle that makes it much easier to store than a cylinder like most tent pack up into. Overall great tent for the money.<br /><br />Update Fall 2017:<br /><br />Took the tent out again camping and this time it had rained before we got there and while we were there. It was damp and cool most of the time we were camping and this tent stayed dry. I had a small amount of condensation on my sleeping bag where the foot of my sleeping bag had touched the end of the tent while sleeping but it dried out quickly (we were on a hill and I slid down in the night). Other than that, everything stayed dry. It was the driest I have stayed in a tent.",[],B012FCGZXQ,B012FCGZXQ,AETXTTZDLCNW36N6T5II3UMSGFYQ,1477447021000,5,True

1.0,Doesn't Shine as much.,"Misfit shine was my second Fitness Tracker after I was highly disappointed by Misfit Flash. Here is my breakdown and comparison of the two products:<br /><br />PROS: -<br />1. Band - Misfit Shine band is better than Flash band any day. It secures the device in place unlike Flash where the device kept falling out.<br />2. The LED lights - Not only they tell you the goal achieved but also the time.<br />3. Size - It's sleek device and very light, you won't even notice that you are wearing one.<br />4. Battery - It has CR2032 battery which unlike rechargeable trackers is so much better, because you don't have remove the device every now and then to recharge and then perhaps keep forgetting to wear it again.<br />5. Water Proof - Misfit guarantees the Water Proof on this device which is a big plus, now you don't have to take the device off you at all and you can we worry free of ruining the device because of that dip in pool, ocean or that trip to water park.<br />6. Misfit Support - They are very prompt at responding to the emails.<br /><br />CONS -<br /><br />1. Never ever Syncs with App - It has been more than 4 months with this device and despite several emails and not much helpful resolutions from Misfit support team my pain and agony continues. the device just doesn't seem to sync with neither Android or iOS device.<br /><br />It is the single most important and yet most frustrating experience I have.<br /><br />My 1 star are for all the agony and pain with this product and the fact that Misfit Support has not been able to find a possible resolution in more than 4 months.<br /><br />Update : 12/18/2015 - The  product has not synced with the App in more than 3 weeks now and I try daily.",[],B00G9N3I7O,B00GN6ZSKC,AG4W7DXGM7DRL2HQSAO4KYTPQ65Q,1448813436000,0,True

2.0,"OK Product, but not as Effective as a Competitive Product I Subsequently Bought on Amazon!","This product's description currently under review as posted by the vendor in his Amazon marketing webpage:  MODVEL Knee Braces for Knee Pain Women & Men - 2 Pack Knee Brace for Knee Pain Set, Knee Brace Compression Sleeve, Knee Braces for Knee Pain Meniscus Tear, ACL & Arthritis Pain Relief - Knee Sleeves.<br /><br />I snapped up this product almost immediately after I found it amongst the long list of knee support products on Amazon.  In retrospect, I now realize this was a major potential purchase selection deviation for me as I'm normally very patient and efficient when it comes to searching through the many review offerings readily available on Amazon.  I own up to my ""faux pas"" and have subsequently ""paid the price"" of a relatively poor purchase.  I say ""relatively"" because although I only rate this product in the 2 stars category, I'm still able to use it on a back-up basis whenever the subsequent, much superior knee support product I purchased on Amazon becomes unavailable - - such as being in the laundry, along with the ensuing lengthy air drying process.  However, whenever I have to resort to the back-up plan, my poor, pleading knees beg for me to finish the current task ASAP so we can move on to the next project and soon get back to the much more favored, awaiting support braces that my knees love and embrace.<br /><br />The problem with this initial pair of knee braces I bought is the fact they're kind of too lightweight in their material composition.  Even though this product seems to have garnered a copious amount of high Amazon ratings - - I just don't see anything that would deserve such high esteem from other users (after my having worn and well-evaluated their usefulness after many months of service by now). I mostly base this on the fact that my aching knees just don't feel any kind of helping pain-support relief that I now experience with the aforementioned favorite support pair I now use as my primary, go-to pain reliever.<br /><br />I'm no expert in joint support relief aids, but if I were asked, I'd say that the three most salient features that this under-performing pair herein under review don't have - - vs. my newer favorite pair - - is the fact that they're just, flat-out not rigid/stiff enough for ample support as well as the fact they don't contain the significant, raised circular, reinforced knee cap support that encircles the entire outer knee cap with a firm, reinforced user-confidence-inducing feeling of support in the newer braces. The third lacking feature that this current review pair fail to possess are the rigid, steel stays - - such as found in waist support belts - - located on both sides of each brace and running the full length of the new braces.  (please see the accompanying photos by way of comparison for visual verification of what I speak and note the side stays and the knee cap supports to which I allude.....they're only in the beige colored pair in the lower portion of the photo as seen below the black pair currently under review).<br /><br />One other important note of importance regards price comparison. Knee braces are apparently not uniform in the amount of pieces in which they're offered. For instance, in the attached photo comparison, the upper black ones under review are sold as a PAIR for about the same price of a SINGLE piece of the newer ones I favor - - what I'm trying to convey is that this item under review is sold as a PAIR for about the same total price for the pair as a single sale brace which is sold only as an individual unit.  No small wonder in the pricing disparity in that the latter units are easily worth double the price IMO.  I did at least take advantage of my second pair of knee brace acquisitions by first ordering the single unit and then after thorough testing, I jumped at buying the second one for my other needy knee.<br /><br />That's about it for now. As i state in many of my Amazon reviews (since I'm a prolific purchaser of so many excellent Amazon-offered products), I promise to return at a later date to edit/update this review in the event something of newfound consequence - - be it positive or negative - - arises.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81OvP6zfMRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81OvP6zfMRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81OvP6zfMRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09238VWK3,B0BXPRMHHM,AEULTVA7ALBGA2UYYVVDLA74CMZQ,1663905431864,8,True

5.0,The instructions state to but the top on last but it is pretty heavy so I put it all together at once ...,I received my machine yesterday (11/11/17) and put it together the same day.  It took me about 3 & 1/2 hours but I was watching a football game as I put it together. I built the machine faced down and used a couple of dumbbells to support it.  The instructions state to but the top on last but it is pretty heavy so I put it all together at once then tipped it up on it's base. I did not tighten the bolts that held the top on so I could still maneuver it when I slid the rods in that the smith bar slides up and down on.  The machine went together well and seems extremely sturdy but you will have to have olympic style weights to go on the bar. I though I could leave the ends off and use my standard weights but that does not work.  From what I could tell the smith bat with the ends on it is around 47 lbs so a little heavier than the normal 45 lb bars in the fitness clubs.  I will admit I am excited to use it for the first time tomorrow when I work on my chest and even more excited to do squats with it later in the week.  The last bit of advice I can give is make sure the bars that have the pegs for the smith bar to hang on are to the front.  You will notice they are off centered and need to be to the front of the machine. I found this out the hard way.

4.0,"Good bag, annoying water bottle holder","I like bags and as a result I tend to cycle through different backs frequently. One of my favorite bags was a Maxpedition Versipack that I loved but ended up selling to try something different.  We were expecting our third child and I was thinking about my hospital bag and remembered the Versipack. I jumped on Amazon and looked it up and couldn't justify that expense at the moment. Then I saw this bag...<br /><br />My needs: a bag to hold a change of clothes, phone charger, a bottle of water, and some snacks, nothing fancy.<br />With the birth of our other kids I've used a backpack (1st) and a duffel bag (2nd), both were big and too cumbersome. As a dad you end up with your bag, mom's bag, baby's bag, and a car seat, so I wanted something a little easier to manage.<br /><br />The good: This held everything I needed. A change of clothes, charger, and various items you need for a quick overnight. It's comfortable to wear, and sturdy enough that I didn't worry about throwing it on the floor in the corner of a hospital room. There are a ton of pockets, which is great for keeping organized. The shoulder strap has a lot of adjustment and the bag wears comfortably.<br /><br />While I purchased this primarily for a one time use, this has transitioned into a small diaper bag for our new baby. It's not big enough to support all three of our kids but works great for a couple of diapers, outfit change, swaddle blanket, etc...<br /><br />The downside: The water bottle holder. It is too short to reliably hold a 32 ounce Nalgene (our water bottle of choice). Part of the problem is the construction (It's constructed of one piece of fabric instead of two. Two piece construction would have provided a flat bottom to the pouch). As a result the 32 ounce Nalgene isn't very secure.  Second, there isn't a way to really secure the bottle (the drawstring is not effective at all). On several of my other bags there is a strap that goes over the top of the bottle to hold it in place. This would solve the problem of the shallower pocket with big bottles.  If you are using a skinnier bottle it may function fine, but I ended up carrying my bottle separately.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81UxdHYugBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81UxdHYugBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81UxdHYugBL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00NTS3RDM,B00NTS3RF0,AED6RIQI6RX3NJIH4LHCDG5JK7WA,1534273942000,2,True

These are fantastic for setting up a useful and challenging exercise regimen when traveling, camping or spending time out and away from your home or commercial gym. I drop this in my suitcase and I'm good to go.<br /><br />Quite frankly if you only have $85 to spend these will provide you a home-based gym that is far, far superior to having nothing.<br /><br />As resistance bands go, these are the top of the line...best of breed.

Done<br /><br />Ease of Use:  These traps have the same basic mechanism that is not to hard to figure out.  My 12yo usually sets it.<br />Quality of Construction:  The traps that arrived was constructed of a smaller gauge of wire coated with green plastics to perhaps add strength; it is nowhere near as sturdy as the trap I had used.  The dead end door is very flimsy and uses a large 'safety pin' that spans the width of the door to secure it.  Since the metal is so flimsy, it is easy to bend up from the corners; a strong raccoon would probably be able to bend from the corner to squeeze its way out.  Also raccoons can reach and pull on mechanism; this happened on the last trap but held him anyway.<br /><br />I am going to test it anyway.  I have added a couple of D-rings at the corners to remedy the weakness at the dead-end door.",[],B013RKRE4Y,B013RKRE4Y,AFYRLDAKKXCNACKQ4IOH5EG4XOGA,1591793280676,2,True

The batteries are also a little tricky to change.  They flip around in the hole and it might take you several tries to get them (3) to all line up correctly.  Then after about shooting 50 rounds the laser fell off from the recoil.  I tightened the rod that keeps the laser attached to the rail very tight but it still loosened.  It also left scratches on the edges of the rail when it fell off.

I bought the mounting hardware at my local hardware store.  5 minutes to install my own brackets.<br /><br />I opened the Amazon box and found the TRX straps nicely packaged in their own bag.  I immediately set them up and clipped them on to my mounting brackets.<br /><br />This is the first time I use these type of TRX straps so I had to YouTube different exercises.

Most likely will have to cancel my week long Trip to Flaming Gorge since I will not be able to use the downriggers and lose my hotel deposit.

5.0,Probably the best Exercise Bike you can buy in this price range,"OK, the first thing I noticed when the package arrived is how heavy this thing was. It is a beast and is what the box states, ""two person carry""!! The UPS delivery left it outside next to the garage door, so I slide this thing into the garage and checked the packaging. I a few holes in the cardboard, but nothing I was too concerned about.<br /><br />Once in the garage, I laid the box down on its side, opened it, and slide everything out. All the parts were intact and packaged very well. I began to pull out all the pieces and lay them out so I could see what level of effort was going to be needed to assemble. There were not very many pieces, but I decided that instead of assembling this in the garage, it might be best to take the parts to the place I intended on keeping the bike (this was a good call on my part). Considering the frame and flywheel were already together, the remaining pieces were for the base, the seat, the handlebars, and the pedals.<br /><br />After taking all the pieces to the assembly area, and following the instructions, I was totally done in about 20 minutes. My first impression after it was done was WOW! Not only is this thing solid as a rock, but it also looks AWESOME. I researched a lot of bikes, and this one had everything I needed, but it also is the one that visually caught my eye during the research.<br /><br />I have had the bike for 4 days now and have but a little over 20 miles on it and I have been impressed with it on every ride: solid and does not wobble, seat and handle-bar adjustments meet my needs, and the on-board module does a lot, to include heart rate. I will say that I also where a Garmin watch, and I have added the Garmin Speed and Cadence sensors to this bike to further track my activities, but the bike already does that as well (I used the sensors, and my watch, so I do not have to manually load my data into the Garmin Connect app).<br /><br />Overall, I do not see how you can go wrong with the PooBoo C-580. You can spend a lot more money on some of the common name exercise bikes, but this one is commercial grade for a fraction of the money and well worth the purchase.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Carre8z5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Carre8z5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Carre8z5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GLTQfEwqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GLTQfEwqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GLTQfEwqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81VDyE4v8pL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81VDyE4v8pL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81VDyE4v8pL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08HTV7V7G,B08HTV7V7G,AE5QSNG4D52VCMMG62BQ75GTDS7Q,1611168722535,1,True

The reason for the 4 stars--this is only for one wheel. If you want to secure both wheels of your bike with Wheel Nutz, you  need to shell out for two sets. For how expensive these are, it'd probably be just as monetarily feasible to buy a secondary u-lock to secure your second wheel, which would circumvent the above qualms about brute-force breakage.",[],B00T852TO8,B00T852TO8,AHDNKUDI7NKHX34UT4VADNZC7XGQ,1488946782000,2,False

4.0,One of few bikes rated for over 300lbs.,Purchased bike during pandemic as a new fitness option when everyone was gaga over Peloton. I liked the lower price and that it was rated to hold heavier riders. Bikes that hold heavier riders are harder to find! Bike was well packaged and easy to assemble with only a little confusion. Most of the screws were in an included blister pack except for a few that held the already attached bottle cage to the bike. Figured that out quickly though. Included wrench wasn’t as helpful in securing seat tightly enough and instructions didn’t suggest any tips on doing this correctly. I found a YouTube video to help with that. We enjoy that the bike is super quiet and that the monitor has more stats available to read however there’s no backlight which would be nice. As a novice rider having something written about what the different stats on the monitor are as well as how to adjust bike seat/handle height to your needs would have been nice.  Better placement of the water bottle cage would also be nice.

I have tried many mats before buying this one, and found the Lululemon ones too thin and quick to deteriorate (according to people I asked at my yoga studio. Plus it's a company I would rather not buy from). The Manduka mats I found comfortable but slippery, and the regular Jade mats were too thin for me. This one combines grip with comfort, and it sounds like a good eco-friendly company, so I spent the money.. I practice Power yoga and sweat a lot, which has not affected my grip on the mat: it remains great from beginning to end. It is more comfortable for forearm balances too (no more bruises on my elbows), and it has helped me practicing crow to chaturanga jumps: I'm not afraid to hurt my knees anymore! I've fallen quite ungraciously trying that specific move, and it was like landing on a mattress.

I got lucky when it arrive 2 days after my order. Instruction on the bike were horrible. I had to YouTube it for the help. Took around 30 mins to finish up. After battery was fully charge I took it for a spin and it was dependable, downside is that it can go only 16mph but it’s enough for me since Its under the speed limit. But not after long near the 2nd week, after my shift at work I was heading back home when the bike didn’t turn when I needed to and I got into an accident. I was fine but the bike seat got damage and the wheel was super loose it didn’t turn any direction from the handle bars and I have to walk home with it. I contacted the seller on what happen and show the videos and photos. It took 2 weeks from their response and send me a video on the part to tighten the joint inside the bike handle. I already tighten It when I got the bike, But after that incident the handle brakes starts to loosen and pop out, then the pedals wouldn’t even stay in, it was barely a few days of my accident and the bike started to fall apart.ive message them about it and they tried to low ball me with some cheap repairs, I wanted to redeem the warranty since the bike almost got me killed, Im not secure with this bike and my safety for it. They accept the exchange but when I printed the return slip I only realize it the bike needs to be sent to a providence in China for the warranty redeem. What is wrong with this seller, they want me to send the bike back to China but the warehouse is in LA, California. I message them why I have to send it back over there but not in the warehouse. It’s going to cost more than twice the amount I paid for the bike to send it bike. They responded with another low ball deal and changing the replacement. First they said they will cover the seat, the other message they will replace the pedals, then the other message they said replace the brakes. They answer differently to my question and when I message them why can’t you replace all of it, they didn’t responded back after that...It’s a total of a whole month just to get this death trap of a bike to be replace and Im just tired of this I already message amazon about this I can’t take constant ‘keep away’ with this seller. I should have buy A bike that was amazon trusted store and not a 3rd party. I implore you to read the reviews cause they posted new ones and it’s all the same. I’m not the only who got scammed. I hope I can get my money back from this defective bike....","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61So1BsKBiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61So1BsKBiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61So1BsKBiL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FeD-YiDgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FeD-YiDgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FeD-YiDgL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xLt2WdE5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xLt2WdE5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xLt2WdE5L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07ZZ2SNXT,B07ZZ2SNXT,AFAYIZN5TJR72OFQJULH6OPDMXTA,1594147829957,23,True

For my first hike with these poles, I took them up Mt. San Antonio &#34;Baldy&#34; (10,064) in Southern California.

Personally, I believe the strain on my legs was reduced by 10 to 15 percent.<br /><br />The double telescopic poles are good for anyone up to about 6'2&#34;. I am 5'6&#34; and based on where mine were set, there was about 6 to 8 inches more to play with. Everything remained in tact and I put them through some very rocky terrain for about 6 miles (including return hike).<br /><br />My only knock on them comes from the 3 or 4 times I put some extra weight on one of the poles either stepping down or going up, and the telescope retracted 3 or 4 inches. I knew for a fact each one was snap locked into place because I made extra sure after the first time it happened. I am 150 lbs., so anyone heavier might need to be a little more conscious of that.<br /><br />Overall, one of the best, if not THE best 22 dollar outdoor equipment purchase I have made.

My wood stock was hacked down so short, and missing the sling stud, so I purchased this for practical reasons. It fit very well. I only had to shave a small amount of material where the bolt handle closes with a razor blade then sand with 220 grit sand paper and it looks perfect. The fit was a bit sloppy in places, due to rifle variations, but it doesn't stand out. There is a small recess where the barrel band would go for certain rifle models and since mine doesn't have the band, there is a small gap under the rear sight between the barrel and stock, but it is not very noticeable.<br /><br />It took 5 minutes to install. And 5 more to do the minor fitting.<br /><br />The stock itself is a bit heavy, but that's not always bad. I was thinking it would be lighter then it is. But that shows quality with these types of molded items.<br /><br />One thing I noticed was the lack of material around the rear screw.

The fit is more upright than a mountain bike and way more comfortable. The display and functions are easy to see understand and execute. The shifting is smooth and the electric boost seamless. I have the mid drive motor which makes it feel more like natural pedaling instead of the rear hub which I have been told makes you feel like being pushed from behind. It is heavier than other bikes I have had but even an old lady like me can lift it In two goes front wheel then back onto my cars bike rack. So I can take this anywhere and so far I have all the way from New Jersey to New Mexico. Now for the down sides and there are a couple. I have a step through and it is really tight to do with the battery where it is but I just lean the bike to me to make it easier also get a heavy duty bike lock as ebike are a prime target for thrives.

5.0,Possibly size UP,"Firstly, it is very soft like all Columbia fleeces. It's very comfortable, but rather fitted and a tiny bit tight at the shoulders (for me). Idk if it's because my shoulders are a bit wider than average. I'm 5'3 and 113lbs, and bought an X-SMALL.<br /><br />It doesn't feel particularly thick, and from my experience with Columbia fleece jackets, they are not so good at wind resistance, so if you're planning on wearing this in windy regions, definitely wear something over or under it. The length is great though, it completely covers my butt (remember, I'm fairly average height at 5'3 so your mileage may vary) so I could wear this with leggings. I probably could've gotten a SMALL, and the shoulders would be more comfortable as well as being a more relaxed fit. Especially if I want to layer thicker clothes underneath.<br /><br />Overall, I like it. I wish it was thicker fleece, as that would really make it a great fall/winter jacket. To me, it seems more suited for spring/early fall weather. Howeverr, I got it on sale, so I can't complain! Next time, I will get a small for the sake of my shoulders!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mW8iQW2ML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mW8iQW2ML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mW8iQW2ML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07K2YMX5D,B0BQ4R88CF,AGF477TC2CLLJHBJ4D7RYE63HICQ,1653002450345,1,True

If it happens to get snow in it, just blow it out and you're good to go again.

5.0,A good buy for a fat tire ebike,"First of all, no lock is going to completely protect any bike from a determined/professional thief. That said, this folding lock was at a good price point compared to some other similar brands. Even so, do your research for length, strength, carrying, and use. This lock is fairly long, making it a bit more versatile. It is comparative strong and resistant to most ""opportunity-type thieves"" in lower crime areas. It is fairly easily mounted to your bike (either with screws or bands), though it pays to check for available space to both mount the lock and remove it from its bracket for use. Removing from the bracket is a bit stiff, but I guess that also keeps the folded lock from vibrating, too. Lastly, this lock/model will allow you to secure a fat tire bike, something more difficult with some U locks.

I did a great deal of research (going back, on and off, to c. 1972) on the Fairborn-Sykes and then Applegate-Fairbairn designs before settling on this knife: it is everything I hoped for in terms of weight, balance, fit/finish, grip and blade; however, the sheath did not thrill me with its single, elastic closure, which grips the handle in such a way as to make it ride up in the plastic sheath liner. I almost gave this purchase a 4 on that account (not because it was 'used, like new' and wasn't - it was pristine) but decided a knife this fine deserves a custom sheath tailored to whomever's doing the carrying anyway.[[ASIN:B001TH5G34 Boker Applegate 5.5 Pocket Knife]]",[],B001TH5G34,B001TH5G34,AHASOAP5WF2T5VMEULBMTSUQRCWQ,1443011511000,4,True

The spout is well covered up when it's closed by a little rubber piece so it doesn't spill when your not drinking, there is also a ridge to hold it, smart, when the bottle is full you need that extra grip. I use this for plain water also, the infuser comes right out it's great as a regular water bottle as well.

The only negative is I should have ordered the jumbo instead of the family. I feel I wasted money only because bigger definitely would have been better.  My own fault.  I thought the family would be big enough.  If you go to the beach often and have 5+ people going definitely get the bigger model.  The ease of setting up and taking down was perfect. Another great feature is that sand does NOT stick to it which makes it easy to store in the bag. Also, a bit windy on the beach today and it stood it's ground.

5.0,Love it besides a couple of small issues...,"Purchased this machine about 3 weeks ago, and have used it a handful of times.  I am not an exercise lover because I get migraines when overheated, so when I discovered pilates from a friend...I looked into this machine because it's low impact, and local classes are very expensive. I LOVE this machine.  I am still learning how to use it, but it is very 'user-friendly' and not difficult.  I need exercise to be easy and quick--so a big set up would deter me.  It isn't perfect--a couple of hiccups, but not enough for me to lower my 'love it' rating:)  You just have to be aware and work with it.<br /><br /> Storage:  The machine says it folds in half, which it does--but only the top portion, which leaves the big stand out with no where to store.  We had to move some things around in our room, but decided to leave it out, at least to start with, so it's easy and convenient.  Now, you don't have to use the base at all, so then it would be easier to fold in half.  Might try that down the road, but for now...make sure there is a place to leave it out.  Measure before you buys--it is a LONG machine.<br /><br />It is pretty heavy...so we put small furniture sliders underneath each pedestal (you need 6 total-I bought them on amazon and they are the size of the pedastal so you can't really tell), which makes it a cinch to slide out from the wall to see the tv, or just to have room to use it.  Highly recommend this unless it is in a place where you don't need to move it.  I leave them on and doesn't affect the workout at all...<br /><br />The DVDs that come with the machine don't work in my macbook nor in my blu-ray player.  I read some reviews on here, and it seems to be a common problem.  I called stamina fitness 2 nights ago and left a voicemail and they returned my call the next morning--they are mailing me new dvd's that will work in my blu ray player.  Haven't received them yet--but I assume they will be fine.  Maybe they will fix this issue soon...<br /><br />I just did my first 'real' workout--found some snippets of videos online and really like this machine...I feel like I got a good workout, and it was fun!  This machine can do  a lot of different things--and I am just getting started.  I am hopeful this machine will continue to give me good results and be easy to use!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610pIRgeOGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610pIRgeOGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610pIRgeOGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LTIMOF80L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LTIMOF80L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LTIMOF80L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B001EV6JKO,B0C2VYXD21,AHAOL72VN66ZPPGKC53KH5SYPQTQ,1434212182000,69,True

5.0,This Is The Tent You're Looking For,"After dealing with several mediocre tents, this thing was a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />- The lightweight material feels impossibly durable<br />- The instructions were clear (they were completely in Japanese, and while I can read Japanese the illustrations would be sufficient for anyone), waterproof and attached to the tent bag.<br />- The zippers all have high contrast pulls so they're easy to find even in low light<br />- The poles use a peg-and-eyelet mechanism to secure them to the tent corners which is so much nicer to work with than the ring-pin mechanisms.<br />- The poles are correctly sized - they provided good tension without making it difficult to fasten them<br />- The rain fly covers the ENTIRE tent and thanks to some thoughtful design sheds rain very well<br />- There are fasteners and clips for holding the rainfly open<br />- There are two bags on the walls for keeping small objects off of the floor of the tent rather than just one<br />- The tent flaps (doors) are generously sized and unzip almost completely<br />- The provided stakes are actually decent - thick, come to a point (rather than the cheapest crap imaginable that you get with a lot of other tents in this price range)<br />- The rain fly has two vents that are easy to prop open<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />- nothing<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />This is the best two-person tent I've ever used bar none.  It's thoughtfully designed, lightweight, durable, and configurable.

5.0,"Great for short, low resistance cardio workouts--but lacks training video and isn’t the best for sand","I rated this 5-stars because personally, for my situation, I love it. But I can see why others might rate it lower.<br /><br />##### What I love about it #####<br /><br />I’m not a boxer at the ringside warming up for a match. I’m a 40-year-old man who spends a lot of time at a desk. I no longer have a gym membership and got tired of doing Billy Blanks Tae Bo workouts on the television. Treadmills get boring, and this time of year it’s too hot to ride a bike outdoors.<br /><br />Where am I going with this? Basically, I was in need of something to motivate me to exercise. That’s why I gave this Ringside Punching Bag a try. And I’m glad I did.<br /><br />A short workout on the bag gets my heart pumping. I don’t have to commit a lot of time on it to feel like I accomplished something. Striking the bag, along with weaving and footwork, requires a good amount of energy and concentration. Even soft punches provide decent cardio. The bag isn’t as heavy as sand filled bags I’ve hit in the past. Those seemed too hard against my knuckles, and hurt my hands and wrists. This one is very soft, yet dense enough to take a strong hit. The spring has a fair amount of give too, allowing less muscled individuals to move it with a single punch. Less resistance = less painful repercussion. Even though it's not hanging, it stays upright even when hit hard. As a 199lb man, I’m able to hit it fairly solidly. If I slam my fist into it at full power, I do feel my knuckles punching deep into the pad and against the more dense backing. But a good hit at say, 70% strength, feels comfortable. That’s bare fisted. I’ve since picked up a set of inexpensive Everlast boxing gloves, and hitting feels even better now.<br /><br />Because there’s a generous amount of give to the bag, lightweight individuals—like my wife—can get a good workout. And individuals like me, who suffer from tendonitis in my forearms and nerve issues in my wrists, can temper punches while still working up a sweat. That, and I find having a physical object directly in front of me provides an extra level of engagement. Unlike a treadmill, it keeps my interest, and is kinda fun too--beating on things that don’t punch back, ha!<br /><br />##### What I don’t love about it #####<br /><br />While assembly isn’t difficult, getting water into the base is a pain. The base comes in two separate parts, each with a hole about 3/4” wide. I originally bought sand to put into the base, but with the holes that small I quickly gave up on the idea. (I can’t imagine what a nightmare it would be if I had to get sand out of the base let alone in it.) I used water instead, and even then, I needed a funnel to get the liquid into the holes (the base is too big to fit into my two-sided sink, so I used the spray head). To me, this seems like a poorly thought out construction. That said, thankfully it holds up to 140 pounds of water, so I found that water is heavy enough to keep the bag upright—even when hitting hard. And since a cap goes over the holes, water doesn’t leak out onto my floor.<br /><br />The product does NOT come with an exercise video. The Ringside website lacks videos too, but they do have a vimeo channel. Unfortunately, I only found short clips, not full workouts. Being that they are promoting a fitness angle with this bag, it would have been nice for them to provide some training. But they don't.<br /><br />Because the bag is on the ground, it doesn’t have a constant swinging motion. Bags that hang from a chain can swing for several minutes with a single push. This one only swings for about three seconds. This means you can’t to do much in the way of non-punching footwork.<br /><br />I notice creases on the surface of the punching bag. The foam inside is wrapped in plastic, so the wrinkles in the plastic shows through. I’ve considered unzipping the vinyl shell and removing the plastic, but am worried that might lower the shock absorption and affect the punching impact. Ultimately, this is just a cosmetic thing (doesn’t hurt my fists), so it’s not that big a deal.<br /><br />##### MSL Details #####<br /><br />It comes in a single large box, with the punching bag, base pad, two parts of plastic base, resistance spring, and bolts. It comes with an Allen wrench to assemble the bolts, but I found that to be a bit tedious. Ended up using a #5 drive bit on my drill to make assembly quicker.<br /><br />The height of the unit from top to bottom is 5’6.” I’m 6’ tall and find the height is just fine for a man of my size. The striking surface is 15” x 56.” The plastic base is 10” high, base pad 11” high, and punching bag 45” high. The bag diameter is 15” and base diameter is 28”.<br /><br />I have the base 20” away from the wall, and the bag does not swing far enough to hit it (even when punching hard). The manual states that one should avoid pushing or bending the bag beyond 30 degrees.<br /><br />The stitching is good; didn’t see any lose treads, missed sections or flawed alignment. Though I would still avoid hitting the seams.<br /><br />It is recommended to wear boxing gloves, remove any rings or sharp objects, remove shoes (when kicking), and keep out of direct sunlight.<br /><br />##### Conclusion #####<br /><br />Like I said, I love this bag because it gives me a good workout in a short amount of time. It has enough resistance to take my hits, but not too much to cause an excess of hand/wrist/arm pain. I recommend getting boxing gloves to go with it (not included), and would suggest staying away from using sand in the base. So far, water is working fine for me. No leaks or spilling (the plastic is sealed well). If you want something you can slam excessively, I might look for one with a heavier bag. This one is really best for cardio workouts, not mass power punches. Just keep in mind you don’t get an exercise or training video. You’ll need to come up with your own plan or search for a third-party one (which seem to be fairly scarce).","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-70x82uQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-70x82uQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-70x82uQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61PTL0yOIxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61PTL0yOIxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61PTL0yOIxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61bavFfn09L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61bavFfn09L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61bavFfn09L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vYzonZJbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vYzonZJbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vYzonZJbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712APSkwqBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712APSkwqBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712APSkwqBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EfIwvqcmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EfIwvqcmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EfIwvqcmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lVDvYf4GL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lVDvYf4GL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lVDvYf4GL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71piQWAtOZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71piQWAtOZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71piQWAtOZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71w3Rc6dNrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71w3Rc6dNrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71w3Rc6dNrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zLCKwsOoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zLCKwsOoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zLCKwsOoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B009O3SCFE,B009O3SCFE,AF3IEBH5ARMPBOVEX7VFANWDYSBQ,1503678355183,22,False

5.0,Waterproof Enough To Survive An Hour At Shallow Submersion,"This watch has the usual standard features that most sport watches have: 24 hour time, stopwatch, date, daylight savings programming, and a long watch battery.  These functions are all straightforward, though there needs to be an instructions card in this box (as a Vine reviewer, I get these before commercial production at times, so this is easily rectified).  The one interesting claim was how waterproof it was.  I was not able to test the claim of 10 M (I am simply not a diver), but I do swim, and I wanted to test the watch under long periods of water submersion.  This watch is at least IPX7 quality because the does survive shallow submersion (&lt;2 feet) for an hour.  The next day, I then tossed the watch into the 5 ft. part of the pool and waited another hour.  In both cases, the watch did not get any water penetration, but I did also follow the instructions not to use the buttons until it dried off.  This is a good standard sports watch that can be used in a water situation which may differentiate it enough from the normal competitors if priced competitively.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71G-DO+6CDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71G-DO+6CDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71G-DO+6CDL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KsbJl7zxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KsbJl7zxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KsbJl7zxL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07CZC471M,B07CZC471M,AG64QU36VOC6IXY3E5YWVPOXOHDQ,1568052326976,1,False

As soon as I went to close it out and put it away a wind out of nowhere came out. It lifted the tent while i had it in hand and was going to blow away.  Well one of the legs came loose.  I said ok well this should be easy to connect because the tent had great reviews.  Well It definitely was not easy to connect.  I put it away and tried when i was at home inside my garage so that there would not be any wind! Could not put the one leg back on the tent.  So now we can't use it! After one use!!!!!

He can barely make it through doors, and the sound of him clonking around makes all of us miserable.<br /><br />I thought I'd give the Suitical a try, just to see if I could come up with an alternative that kept him comfortable.<br /><br />I am not exaggerating when I say I am in love with this thing. He never touched his stitches. Not once. And he seemed ... calmer. Like this doggy onesie was giving him a big hug.<br /><br />The only downside is having to chase him around to unfasten the snaps before he goes to the bathroom. It's like having a toddler again. But totally worth it.<br /><br />For reference, he's a golden retriever/great Pyrnees mix who weighs in at close to 110 pounds. He looks like a hipster poet with his tufts of chest hair puffing out from his turtleneck, but the XL fits him perfectly.",[],B00W2EHWRQ,B07KFV26NB,AERQ4JH37IFYVRRR3KKLXZZMGEAA,1612039938662,0,True

5.0,Perfect light for my evening commutes,"I have been biking to work for the past year, though I stopped during the long dark nights of Winter. Even though the August sun is still shining late into the afternoon, I have a project that is keeping me in the office well into the darker hours of late night. Rather than put aside the bike I decided to purchase a light that would help me to navigate the dark suburban roads between my office and home. Many of those roads are not well lit and can be littered with tree branches, glass and pot holes. Speed limits often exceed 40 mph so being seen by cars is critical.<br /><br />After a few days of research, and having read hundreds of reviews for dozens of products, I decided upon this Cateye Nano for the front, and the [[ASIN:B007GB2V5S Topeak Mega Red lite (3x1.5x1.5-Inch)]] for the back.<br /><br />Here's what made me decide on the CatEye:<br />1 - Rechargeable with standard USB cord. No batteries to buy. Easy to charge at home and the office. Environmentally friendly.<br />2 - Bright as all blazes. Even in the 'dimmer' mode, this is a bright light. In high power mode it is amazingly bright. Moreover the hi-lo flash mode allows me to see the road AND for cars to be alerted to me while still a mile away. It's a great safety feature.<br />3 - Easy to install but the light is easily removable for theft prevention. Installing the mount took all of a minute. The locking mount allows you to remove the light for safety, and to put it back in the mount with one easy motion.<br />4 - One button - easy to operate, hard to screw up.<br /><br />I have been using it for several days and I am a huge fan. This may be enough to convince me to ride the bike throughout the Winter, or at least late Autumn.",[],B008QVXBJC,B008QVXBJC,AFTJPO5YBDGLYTFEQFYQ3BZ7W6CA,1376921209000,0,True

It was delivered two days earlier than I expected, and the carrier called for an appointment and they were prompt and carried the box just where I wanted it.  The directions say you need two people, but I put it together myself in about 1 1/2 hours.  You'll need some of your own tools, but they supply the allen keys for the bolts that need them.  The parts were packaged well and easy to identify, and the directions were easy and clear for each step.  Read them all first before starting, it will help.  The only issue I had was I some of the screws went in REALLY hard, and I was worried about stripping them, but it was all fine.  I called Proform customer service and waited quite a long time before giving up and calling back and speaking to someone in sales instead, since all I wanted to know is if I had to install the fold up storage support locking bar if I never intended to move it, and they said it's not necessary.

3.0,Game cameras are a crap shoot - this one is OK,"This camera has held up so far, for perhaps 6 months use (it wasn't out in the heat of mid-summer).  Every game camera, with perhaps a few recent (and expensive) exceptions, seems to have quality and performance issues.  This one, at least, is still going, and gets decent photos much of the time.<br /><br />I've stuck with still photos, in bursts of 3, and high motion sensitivity most of the time, so this review won't evaluate the video capabilities - though I may give them a try some day.  I run it a 5 MP, which appears to be the &#34;sweet spot&#34; in quality for this camera, I believe that the 8 MP photos are oversampled  (going from memory here!)<br /><br />A common failing of game cameras is taking night photos in the early twilight or day photos in the late twilight - thus giving massively over or under exposed photos, just at the time most animals are active.  This one has only done that a couple of times (another popular brand makes a RULE of mis-exposing such photos!).<br /><br />It is generally out behind the house, sitting on the ground and pointed up the mountain slope toward a large boulder, as there is a game trail just this side of that boulder.  There is the issue of lots of false exposures on very windy days, where the swaying of the creosote bushes trigger it - but I like the high sensitivity to catch small animals at some distance, so just delete the extra photos.  That only happens once every few weeks (there aren't many bushes right there to begin with).<br /><br />I live in the Mohave desert, so heat, not cold, is the issue here.  So far, it has held up to the heat OK, though I've avoid exposing it to the sun during the blast-furnace days of summer.  It has been out in several days of rain and drizzle - again with no ill effects.<br /><br />You do lose sensitivity during the heat (which the instructions indicate).  When everything is hot, the heat of an animal just doesn't stand out to the sensor.  In sub-100 degree temperatures, maximum sensitivity gets the job done - though nothing like when the temperature is lower and much better range for smaller animals is common - but this is going to be an issue for most any IR sensor game camera.<br /><br />Similarly, the IR feature is a mixed bag, as with most all of these cameras.  Overexposed on the close ones, underexposed on the far ones, and blurry if there is any significant movement at all.  I don't think any reasonably priced game camera avoids these issues (though they do make a few flash units that take color flash photos at night - to the consternation of the animals photographed, I'm sure!  Blurring on motion of the night photos is the biggest issue, and it is certainly an issue.  I haven't looked carefully to see if other cameras shorten the exposure enough to help in that area.<br /><br />I get photos of passing quail all the time, occasionally a dove or cactus wren.  Occasionally a rabbit (desert cotton-tail - the jack rabbits are seen nearby, but not right here, even on the mountain for some reason).  A local bobcat has been photographed both night and day.  We got a night shot of a kit fox - I've never seen one around here, but they obviously are.<br /><br />One of the weaknesses of these cameras is their shutter delay.  This one is proud of its short delay, but there are better (and worse) ones.  Where I have it sitting, a lot of animals pass very close to it.  For fast moving ones, all you get is the tail in one photo and nothing in the next two of the 3 shot burst.  Coyotes are usually fast movers, so they are blurred (at night) and often only a tail or hind-quarter is seen.  Similarly road runners - I get the distinctive tail, if anything.  Bobcats, rabbits, mountain sheep, many birds, you get the whole critter, often in all three shots.  For night shots, the click of the IR filter being retracted will often attract their attention and you get a nice &#34;posed&#34; shot with them looking toward the camera.  That, and perhaps the dim glow of the IR, seems to attract their attention, but not scare them away.  Works for the bobcat and rabbit, but not for the coyotes or foxes.<br /><br />Battery life has been &#34;OK&#34;.  It is on its second set of batteries (that I can recall), and I only put in 4 at a time.  With the heat, putting in all 8 might not help much with longevity (as it should), since the heat may kill them as fast as the current drain.  One irritation: replacing the 4 batteries causes loss of date and time, requiring it to be reset.  I'll experiment with temporarily adding batteries up to 8 before replacing the first 4 to see if that avoids that minor hassle.  (Whether a warning about that is in the manual, I don't recall.)<br /><br />At least the menu and controls aren't too difficult.  Between the simple graphic button labels and a little experimentation, they are quickly re-mastered each time they are required, without consulting the manual.<br /><br />Photo reliability has been so-so.  Every once in a while I get a partial photo (top half or 2/3 only), or an unreadable photo.  Once, I had to do a &#34;repair&#34; on the directory structure of the SD card in Windows 7 to get it to display the photos.  Obviously, there are occasional glitches in the writing of a photo, with bad photos or even a messed up directory entry resulting.  So far, that has only been a minor irritation - resulting in one photo of a group of 3 being bad every great once in a while.<br /><br />I bring in the camera and download photos every week or two (it is right behind the house, I could do it daily if I wanted).  It is a bit of a chore to go through the false wind photos, all the quail photos, etc., and looking carefully at each one for some small animal not immediately apparent in the background.  Nearly every time however, we are rewarded with a nice photo or two of some rarely seen animal.<br /><br />This isn't a great game camera - and Bushnell has already brought out new models with significant claimed improvements.  However, for the price (I paid $140, which is still the current Amazon price), it may be about as good as you're going to get.  (At least as of earlier in 2013, when I bought it).<br /><br />If you want a game camera for the back yard, to get decent quality photos, in a variety of lighting situations, of not too rapidly moving animals, at a &#34;reasonable&#34; price, this one is a good choice.  For more demanding situations (fast moving game, very difficult lighting, critical uses like isolated hard-to-reach hunting locations), I'd want something more reliable taking and recording photos, quicker on the shutter, etc. - and I'd end up paying a lot more for it.",[],B004MC1WC2,B004MC1WC2,AGIAXOHWVXF43A2QLMZJ3JH6SILQ,1388096384000,0,True

3.0,Decent pillow - but could be better,"I got the medium - actual size is pretty much what I expected but, in hindsight, I probably would have gotten a larger size due to my high head:pillow size ratio. The directions say to wash it and tumble dry &#34;for maximum loft&#34;. I did as directed and did indeed pull a loftier pillow out of the dryer. It's fairly fluffy but you can definitely feel the clusters of filling. It's not like a regular bed pillow. Also, if I lay my head on it for longer than a few minutes, it leaves a head-shaped impression in the pillow that doesn't bounce back without considerable punching, squeezing and fluffing. I can see this being bothersome in the middle of the night. Still, I assume this is to be expected for a pillow like this. Plus, I tend to sleep pretty deeply when I'm camping especially after a long day of exertion - which is how I tend to camp (hiking, canoeing, fishing, etc.) I will probably put a small bag of clothes or something similar under it to make it a little higher. Overall, it's a good pillow for the money. There are other brands for a few more dollars with excellent reviews that I might have sprung for had I known about the above mentioned &#34;flaws&#34; (they're hardly &#34;flaws&#34; - just not 100% comfortable).

I had to push the whole thing really far forward because of the pistol scope's long eye relief so the rig cantilevers out and rests on my pellet barrel with a built in set screw on one end.  It clamps on the 11 mm dovetail rail just fine.  The base of the see through section a bit too tall.  I can't use the iron sights but it's not very expensive so I'm not out much.  I was going to send it back but never got around to it.  Maybe I'll keep it on the 1389.  It doesn't seem to fit the 3/8 dovetail.  The edges are pretty rounded and it won't really clamp onto a 3/8 dovetail.

4.0,Triple function Mattress pump.,"This was bought as a part of my lightweight backpacking setup. This piece of gear actually serves three purposes. The first being that it can blow up my exped UL7 MW air mattress. Its not quit as easy as they make it out to be, therefore a star is subtracted, but its also not difficult. You simply attach it to the intact hole, scoop the bag upwards, the fold the lip closed twice, then gently push on it to inflate the mat. It takes roughly 3 bags full to fill the mattress. The second use for this bag is for my exped pillow LG. It works the same, except is completed in 1 bag. The final use it as a water proof bag liner for the inside of my back. I stick all my gear inside of it as a water barrier. It speaks to how tough and well made this bag is. By all technicality you could even haul water with this ting, though you'd want to dry completely it before pumping up your air mattress, to keep condensation from creating mold..<br /><br />Cons: Not as simple as I wished it was. I wish the folding collar was a 1/4 to 1/2 inch taller to help with folding down.

The grip on the joola is slightly nicer, which is to be expected.<br /><br />My opinion, if you're just getting into pickleball, you probably won't notice a difference between the grip each paddle has on the ball. Save yourself some money and go for the Franklin.<br /><br />However, if you play ranked pickle ball then I'd definitely recommend the joola. It felt like it had more grip to me, and probably would require a greater skill to even reach the potential of the paddle.<br /><br />I'll update in the future after I get an opinion from my friend that plays ranked pickleball, he'll have some additional insights for sure. As for the average to beginner player, this is what I think of these two paddles.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-Q8JRa7mL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-Q8JRa7mL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-Q8JRa7mL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GyYS8LfdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GyYS8LfdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GyYS8LfdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71P8JcyUnFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71P8JcyUnFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71P8JcyUnFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XPhBgMetL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XPhBgMetL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XPhBgMetL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71meQw227+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71meQw227+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71meQw227+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71paL0XYr2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71paL0XYr2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71paL0XYr2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B57NLB43,B0C3ZJLY3V,AFTSLID57UKGNP2EOLAQIITOQIWA,1665724587826,1,False

For years I was one of those guys who placed his tactical or ballistic vests in the closet corner. I bought this for a way to hang my body armor, in fact I am going to buy two more I love this thing so much. The span on the hanger is perfect and the up-tips are great for keeping your gear from sliding off.<br /><br />This is a heavy duty hanger, I chose yellow because it matches my tac vest, I work at the railroad so I have to stand out when I am working around the trains and alignments. This thing again is robust, I hang my vest on it with all the gear (expect the handgun and Taser) and it takes the weight no problem.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Worth every penny for body armor, strong and robust. Price was good for me at around 10.00. I would and am buying more of these for additional equipment hangers.

Just remember no amount of money will ever improve your swing, go spend a few 100 dollars and get with a professional on your form.<br /><br />Also, I haven't had a club break on my first outing so I feel those reviews may be an outlier.

4.0,Great deal for a great board!,"This is a great longboard! Not just as a starter, either. I don't like to call myself &#34;professional&#34;, but I do consider myself to be a longtime skater. This was the first longboard I ever owned, but I've ridden several. Krown is an excellent brand. I personally love the natural wood look, as well as the bamboo graphic. The shipping came about a week earlier than it estimated (I live on the eastern shore of Maryland, if that helps) and there was only one issue I found on the board itself. Everything was perfect except for a very minor scuff I found on the bottom of the deck in the middle. But let's be honest, it's the bottom of the deck. It was going to get jacked up anyway through riding and wear & tear. The wheels and trucks are decent. Not fantastic, but definitely great quality.<br /><br />A personal testimony, I've got a friend who owns a local skate shop in two locations here in Maryland that had this exact board for $99. Also, there's another skate/surf shop on the beach that has the newer model of this same Krown board (just a different shape for the deck) for somewhere around $120.

5.0,Best fire starter in the world,"This thing is amazing. Very solid build. I was nervous during the shipping process because I was hoping I wouldn't get the one with the wrong blade or get tricked into getting the cheaper model, but you can see as clear as day the difference between the stainless steel and tungsten/cobalt blade. The latter has no shine to it at all. Almost a dark cement color to it. I tested this out in the backyard with the included cottonballs and boy did it only take one try. After you scrape off the protective coating, the ""flint"" is silver, like magnesium. The only downside is it was a pain in the bum to put paracord through the lanyard hole. I had to use tweezers and a lot of patience. Overall, I VERY highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a nice quick fire.",[],B0036230ZQ,B07C8MWD8D,AGHRSFE3GAOOUAE37YYLIFGASPOQ,1299271671000,10,True

4.0,"Overall satisfied - ""Good bang for the buck""","I now have a rowing machine (targeting leg strength for my hiking) and this elliptical exercise bike (targeting aerobic for heart strength).  For both machines, I wanted the core functionality (rowing / biking) and reliable equipment (e.g. both are magnetic resistance) and did not care much about ""bells and whistles"" (e.g. fancy displays) since I am watching my video podcasts during workouts.  I figure out what speed, resistance and duration meet my needs and so the only thing on the display is speed.  It seems to me that the fancy displays and programs are about 1/4 to 1/3 of the cost of higher end machines and I was happy to keep that money.<br /><br />As stated in the title, I am overall happy with this machine, but it does have 3 design features that I think could be better.  The first is the arm movement.  It is more up and down than out and back and that doesn't seem as effective.  I noticed that in the video before buying, but this seemed like it would still be a good overall product for my criteria and it is turning out to be true.  Second is that the up and down motion causes the heartbeat pulse sensor edges to dig into your hands and also mess with the accuracy of the heartbeat readings.  I am going to cover them for now and think about options going forward since my watch gives my heartbeat.  The last item is the seat.  It is way too hard and a cushion is in order.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good value for the money because the core functionality works fine and the build is solid with good materials (except for the seat).  Reminder that my criteria for the display is that I only care about the speed.  If you desire lots of functionality in the display, this will not satisfy you.<br /><br />So, short of something unexpected, I expect to use this and my rowing machine nearly daily (not on hike days).",[],B072JHYQGC,B0C44T739P,AEI536OLZCJDAA7XCDFXGQ744RDA,1663861069652,17,True

2.0,Not very durable.,"This is a very expensive pedometer with a few extra features, but not worth the price and I've been disappointed.  I wore mine non stop for 2-1/2 months.  That's when the band broke.  Since you have to remove the actual fit bit every 5 days to charge it, the rubber in one stop on the band gets soft.  Mine eventually showed a little crack.  I knew it was only a matter of time before it broke.  It finally gave out while sleeping one night.  Fitbit support has said they will send me a replacement band at no charge.  So good service there.<br /><br />The sleep tracking is interesting, but rather useless.  Its also a little uncomfortable to sleep with.  The band isn't as soft or smooth to make it comfortable at night.  During the day, its fine, although I did sometime worry that it looked like I was wearing a home monitoring device.<br /><br />Ultimately, I was disappointed that the band broke so soon.  That Fitbit did not merge the Fitbit One technology to allow you to see your step count (this requires an iphone or PC to know how much progress you've made).  Its a little uncomfortable to sleep with. Mine did not record one single flight of stairs climbed, ever.<br /><br />So I'm disappointed in this expensive pedometer, and hope future generations fulfill the product's potential.",[],B00BGO0Q9O,B00BGO0Q9O,AGTBWFM73VYWMSTBY3Y3OMHG6R5Q,1378400865000,0,False

4.0,"It is very well-built, fits both me and my wife.","I think ultimately buying one of these packs comes down to personal preference. 55L is a great amount of storage space and I really like the attachable day pack that is also able to be front- or back-mounted.<br /><br />They say this is a gender-specific fit, but honestly as a 6’1” 175lb dude, this fit me just fine. Also fits my wife fine. There’s so much adjustability I don’t really see how it matters. YMMV but for a lean guy, this is fine.<br /><br />The large bag has a ton of adjustability in the straps and they can be stowed away completely. I don’t quite understand what to do with the cover for the straps when open, though. It just sort of hangs down, or I guess you can roll it up. It feels like there’s an easy solution to stow it neatly, but this bag doesn’t seem to have it.<br /><br />The pack didn’t really come with clear info on the features. I had to watch the video on the Amazon product page to learn, for example, that the front chest strap is also a whistle. Surprised it didn’t have something a bit more explicit considering the plethora of straps and buckles in seemingly random places.<br /><br />Traveling alone, I might pick this over a suitcase. It sure is easier to store when I’m NOT using it. Traveling with kids? Enh…probably would not bring it over a roller suit case. I have so much stuff to carry already, I check big bags and just leave myself as I encumbered as possible.",[],B09ZNKNKZK,B0B5V6C8ZB,AEAY4TC6SA22WXHLVFS6UOHTWQWQ,1667365825060,3,False

The throttle-mode was fun and did rip through the battery, but the pedal assist work as expected.<br /><br />Assembly was straight forward, though it helps if you're handy with some tools and know how bikes are supposed to go together. I needed to make a few adjustments to things like the front fork, but nothing serious. Took me around 1-2 hours to put it together, but I worked slowly just to make sure everything was right (it was).<br /><br />Still early in my ownership of the bike, but it has already met all my expectations and desires.

All you have to do is practice a sort of scooping action (think humpback whales as they lunge to the surface with a mouthful of little fish) as you grab more air.  And the seal worked better than expected.  A second person can make things go faster by pinching the pad airway shut as you unroll the Pumphouse to get more air, but even without a second person filling a couple of sleeping pads was relatively painless.<br />The Pumphouse weighs almost nothing, so I consider it worthy of hauling with us.

5.0,Great cover,"I just purchased an electric bike here in florida where we spend 7 months a year.  The remaining months are spent in New England.  I need a cover to protect the three day trek back to New England.  I purchased the cover but didn’t get a chance to try it out until last week.  I put in on the bike being supported on my hitch of my Jeep. The cover went on pretty easily and I could get it pretty tight.  I used the eye hooks with straps to pull them tight.  Since I lock the bike to the hitch with a heavy duty kryptonite lock I used the eye hooks to further tighten the cover on the bike.<br /><br />I was traveling up I75 from the Naples area to Ocala, florida approximately 4 hours.  I generally travel around 70-78 or so on this highway and was surprised to see it handle the speed.  I noticed the wind travels over the car and pushes the cover tightly to the bike.  I checked it in the side mirrors and it looked fine.  Unfortunately one of the negatives is you cannot see out the rear view mirror.  I’m not sure how this issue could ever be resolved but with side view mirrors it was sufficient.<br /><br />I checked it when we arrived after 4 hours of highway driving around 75 mph and was pleased to see the material didn’t fray nor did it look any worse for wear.  I suspect that it would make the 3 day trip up north without any problems.<br /><br />As for the company, I would also give it high marks for customer service.  I originally bought the two bike version thinking the bulkier ebike might need more room.  It was way too big.  I called them and explained the situation and they sent me a single at no charge. This single one is what I used on my trip.",[],B09PBXRJ49,B08GCHTHCS,AEUNNSX2EC34TRWMWHPOAN5TKT3Q,1678722193137,4,True

5.0,Keeps my little gun snug as a bug.,"I bought this pistol rug to keep my Taurus Spectrum .380 from getting tangled up in the various items in my range bag.<br />As can be seen in my photos, the rug fits the gun and my wife's Ruger LCP, for that matter, perfectly. The Spectrum is a little bigger than the LCP, but there was no problem whatsoever zipping the rug up. When zipped up there is no movement within. There is not a lot of padding, but that is exactly what I wanted. I think this helps to keep the whole rug nice and slim and helps it take up less space in my bag, where it is already protected. The padding that it does have, is perfectly adequate in my opinion.<br />If you have a need to store a subcompact handgun (or other type of gun, they offer other sizes), take some measurements and give this brand a try...I think for the money you may be pleasantly surprised.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LYOSOWTML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LYOSOWTML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LYOSOWTML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81r1tamYA2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81r1tamYA2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81r1tamYA2L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01M3S2UU8,B01NBU5ATR,AGS7K5ENRX7HZMWCO7JIAYVTIS5A,1552946339127,1,True

5.0,Always buy a Rule,"30 years in the yacht service industry has taught me always go Rule, pumps and float switches. I never get callbacks on any products I install for clients, ever, regardless of what it is and I am not just talking about pumps. I install everything you can think of and run a business that will do everything from change out you bilge pump to overhaul your large diesel engines. On to the pump, I have installed these pumps since the early 1990's I have some that have been running for a decade, installation is key factor in longevity, proper wire connectors, watertight and well above anyplace that might get wet, redundancy is key. Next is the float, do not use any electric new fangled switch, you a Rule Super Duty covered Float switch, connections again, watertight and still above any level the may reasonably get wet. One get thing about these pumps is while there have been some improvements over the years, a new pump will still snap into the base of a 30 year old one, makes live a lot easy if you are replacing a pump in a hard to reach area or one that stays very wet. The reason to use a covered switch is to keep any stray foreign objects from get stuck under the float and causing the pump to run dry for a week straight. These things will pump water until the end of time, but a week dry will kill anything.",[],B000O8B6DI,B095F71LFN,AE4S3IFFQI5RBI25XYTZZVDTYMVQ,1653541754654,3,True

There is no discomfort underfoot. The socks are comfortable. Those are the best points. An excellent feature of these socks would have been that they link to a smart phone for controlling the temperature. The app is buggy. First, I need the socks to warm my feet for an entire day. The batteries are only good for about four hours. Extra batteries are not available. I bought a second pair of socks for a second set of batteries. I figured a second pair of socks was a good idea, too, one to wear and one to wash. The link to the phone will only support one set of batteries. The second set of batteries will work like any other heated socks. The battery can be set manually with buttons on the battery. So, one set of batteries controlled from the phone, a second set manually. The app is supposed to be used to register the socks for the warranty and to provide additional software options. Despite too many attempts the software never linked with the product's website to either register or download the extra software. After a couple of weeks the link to the phone failed to work at all.

4.0,These Neoprene Swim Gloves Work Great In The Cold Ocean,"PROS:<br /><br />These have saved my hands and fingers in the open water.

So, if you're usually wearing a fitness watch, it will have to move up your arm a few inches to make way for these gloves.<br /><br />Yes, they can be a pain to take off. They have a velcro strap, making it one extra step to don/doff the gloves. Oh, and you have to rinse them out after each use. Add to that, you have to let them dry between uses. Almost forgot to add that you'll have to pull out the fingers to do so. But, I imagine you'd have to do this with most swim gloves of this type.<br /><br />Altogether, I'd recommend these gloves.

I used the small one, and it was more than enough to dry off after a shower. The large size is a huge plus, and I'll be using it as my beach towel. I'm extremely happy with this set and truly is a great value.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.

4.0,"Good bottle, cap can be improved","I just received this bottle today (I went with the ""carbon"" color).  Overall, I like it, but I think the sip cap can be improved.<br /><br />First color & design:  The carbon is a shade darker than the image conveys.  I'm pleased that's the case as I'm a guy.  Also, the mouth of the bottle is quite wide and doesn't look like it will be difficult to clean. I haven't dropped it yet, but the glass is thick and I think the plastic cover will protect it (i'll write an update after I drop the bottle a time or two - it's only a matter of time).  The carry handle seems to be medium duty -  It'll do the job.  Finally, the bottle is big so it'll hold a good amount of water.  If you're looking for small and dainty - this isn't the bottle for you.  I like the size and feel of it.<br /><br />The cap is well made and has an o-ring to stop it from leaking.  The flip top covering the sipper though seems like it *might* be the weak spot.  I'm not sure if that's the case and time will tell if it will leak.  I wish the bottle had an pressure relief valve to let air in as you drink.  As it is, you can't suck the water out like you can a squeeze bottle and you have to let it pour into your mouth.  Not a huge deal, but it feels like it could be done better.<br /><br />Overall: it's a good bottle that feels like it'll survive some wear and tear.  If you're looking for a glass bottle: this is one to get.  Sure, the cap can be improved, but all-in-all it's a bottle worth considering.",[],B0070TZ7MA,B0070TZ7MA,AFUA3DD5QFRFXFFS4IQ2HJDGH4AA,1389638584000,0,True

As noted above, I have a seat bag (that holds tubes, tools, repair kit, etc.) and prevents the rear light from attaching to the post.<br /><br />My recommendations to the company are twofold: 1) to make the tension on the clip tighter, or even have a locking catch, that will allow the rider to secure it to the back of the bag; and, 2) provide a mounting bracket that can be used on the thinner rear frame tubes.<br /><br />I will have to figure out how and where to mount it with the accessories provided.  Clearly it doesn’t like being clipped onto my seat bag.<br /><br />Overall a good set for the money.  The headlight is bright enough for day use and to make you visible but not really &#34;headlight&#34; strength.  The rear light is bright and has three modes (random blink, steady blink and on) and works well.<br /><br />*Update*<br />I reached out to the company b/c the rear light fell off my seat bag and cracked.  I received a reply on the same day and the company sent me  a new replacement rear light and extra spacers so I can try to mount it on the rear frame.

5.0,Comfortable and warm.,This vest is great for cold outings.  I thought it was kicking off but I read the instructions again and realized that it kicks down automatically to the lower setting if you only turn it on to high.  You can make it stay on high by cycling through the three colors back to red when you turn it on.  So make sure you read the instructions. It goes into a warm up (high) when you turn it on then kicks down to low heat. Other than that it is really logical.  The battery pack is a regular power bank and is labeled clearly.  The power bank is big but is more comfortable than using the power tool batteries in a coat. I have one of those and it is awkward to have that battery against you when you sit in a chair.  You can balance out the weight of the battery by putting your phone in the other pocket.  You could even charge your phone with the battery pack.<br /> I also like that the vest is washable and has a rubber cover for the USB plug when you wash it.  The high neck is warm and stylish.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710RiwS-g8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710RiwS-g8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710RiwS-g8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-HLSPpypL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-HLSPpypL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-HLSPpypL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B65D1SH5,B0BJNTY942,AGGQUWUVBQA722BKRD5CEYMUMDTQ,1667948995643,2,False

5.0,versatile and large,"We got this board for its versatility as a simple kayak and for its heavy weight capacity. It fits the bill in both regards. It comes well appointed with many D rings for attaching to other boats and to attach a kayak-style seat. While lacking the foot rests common to kayaks, this basic seat really helped with the effort to sit in an upright position for extended periods of time. We enjoy floating and swimming around the board. This means that we sometimes have three of us on it while actually moving. Having 400+ lbs on a normal sized paddle board would be too low in the water and also unstable. This board performs far better under heavier load than lower weight rated boards thanks to its width and 11.5' length. That it comes with the kayak seat and double bladed attachment for kayak use is a real bonus that makes it 100% ready for multiple use out of the box. The blades on the paddle are a little on the small side which is ideal for smaller adults. Getting a second set of paddles for use as a double and making the second paddle having larger blades will be my first upgrade. At 22 lbs, this board is only 4 lbs heavier than the lightest board I could find, yet it is much larger and has D rings attached. Features weigh something, and this board is quite light for its size and features. 100% would buy this board again.",[],B07PBT45V6,B07PBT45V6,AE2BAQQHQ6HLPPVYNEOA7GP24VSQ,1625928311026,4,True
